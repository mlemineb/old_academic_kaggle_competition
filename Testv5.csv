not constitute formal, legal recognition of the INC as the government of Libya. We don't consider
Chris Stevens' presence in Benghazi to trigger formal recognition, and we've never broken relations
with Libya despite suspending our embassy operations.
Without question, having a NATO liaison in Benghazi would have the appearance of NATO leaning in
the direction of the INC. But NATO's operations already show a considerable lean away from
Qadhati. Speaking for NEA, I don't mind the appearance. But the real purpose would be to avoid
friendly fire incidents, of course.

,,,, .....Jeff -
Been in touch with ADMs Stavridis and Locklear. They are working the issue hard, thru both US and UK channels, to
solidify liaison cells with the rebels, The diversity of the opposition makes setting up the contacts more difficult, but the
Nato command is fully engaged in trying to set up the right structure to ensure closest possible coordination between
Naples and the TNC.
Relatedly, FR and UK are pushing the idea of sending a Nato liaison to the TNC to work the PA angle as well as to
provide a way to improve communications between INC and Nato HQ on the bigger picture. Sounds sensible, the we
need to avoid sense that Nato is recognizing TNC or wants role in any political process. Would welcome your thoughts onIvo et al: Greetings. Please look at points #3 and #4 below, conveyed by DCM Polaschik from

1) Security situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as
required.
2) Chris spoke to the RADM Foggo, Deputy Commander of the 6th Fleet, who confirmed that the 6th fleet would be
responsible for the team's evacuation if needed.
3) RADM Foggo was very interested in Chris' meeting with TNC Military Coordinator Abdul Fatah Yunis, particularly
Yunis' frustration with the lack of coordination with NATO. Foggo is hopeful that presence of UK military
advisors on the ground in Benghazi will help improve this coordination. According to FogoÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¾ DOD is looking at

envoy's delegation is currently doing a phased checkout (paying the hotel bills, moving some comms to the boat,
etc). He will monitor the situation to see if it deteriorates further, but no decision has been made on departure. He will
wait 2-3 more hours, then revisit the decision on departure.
He received reports of shelling last night in Ajdabiyah as well as snipers shooting people in the city. AFRICOM
reported Qadhafi's forces took the eastern and western gates of Ajdabiyah, with 5 vehicles at the eastern gate and 50 at
the western gate. More Qadhafi forces are heading to Ajdabiyah from Brega.
The Brits report Qadhafi forces are moving from Sirte to Brega, which they interpret as preparation for another
assault on Ajdabiyah today.
He plans to discuss the situation further with the Brits, Turks, and the TNC to see if this is an irreversible
situation. Departure would send a significant political signal, and would be interpreted as the U.S. losing confidence in
the TNC. Initial message to the TNC would frame the departure as due to security grounds and as a temporary measure
only.
Polaschik said she would discuss these developments with Amb. Cretz.
If the group departs, the contract for the boat stipulates they return to Greece. One scenario could be the group
stages elsewhere for a few days.
Ops will continue to monitor the situation.","communityeleven","dimanche","avril","dmilleonze","humaabedin","wkend","wkfifteen","topic17","topic38","topic23",1626,373

June 3, 2011Re: Q's secret bid to UK
On the morning of June 2, 2011 sensitive sources with access to the advisors to Muammar Qaddafi's son, Saif
al-Islam, stated in strict confidence that the Libyan government has opened extremely complicated negotiations
with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire
agreement with the rebels of the Libyan Transitional National Council (TNC), allowing the Qaddafi's to
maintain some level of control in the country.
This initiative is directed by Saif al-Islam and, according to these sensitive sources, the Libyans have asked the
UK officials to broker a deal with the TNC that will allow some form of power sharing, with the possibility of
Saif al-Islam acting as head of state and the TNC members making up a substantial portion of the cabinet in a
new government. Under the plan Muammar Qaddafi would be allowed to leave the country and go into exile
with no danger of indictment on charges of human rights abuses and corruption by Libyan or international
courts","communitythirteen","vendredi","juin","dmilleonze","hillaryclinton","nowkend","wktwentythree","topic17","topic3","topic7",1102,503

playing politics? Or is national security dangerously infected with politics?
It seems as if it would have been simple enough for Rice to quickly admit that the administration talking points
she used on the Sept. 16 Sunday shows about the slaughter in Benghazi were misleading. But she went silent.

spending in Iraq. This includes $553 million for additional Marine security guards; $130 million for diplomatic
security personnel; and $691 million for improving security at installations abroad.
On Monday, an independent panel that was established to investigate the attack presented the report to the

chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The board is authorized by a 1986 lavv intended to strengthen security at

I wanted to reach out to you directly after this challenging week, and express my gratitude for everything you
do to advance our nation's interests and values. That is how we keep faith with those we serve and honor
those we've lost. Even after four years, I continue to be amazed by your dedication, energy, and talent. It is a
privilege to be part of your team.
I also want to thank everyone who is working so hard to provide all our people and posts with the best
possible leadership, security and support. As Deputy Secretaries Burns and Nides told Congress on Thursday,
our colleagues in Diplomatic Security, Near Eastern Affairs, and in every bureau across the Department, at
home and abroad, get it right countless times a day, for years on end, in some of the toughest circumstances
imaginable. We need to learn from the tragedy in Benghazi, and make every possible improvement -- and we
will. We also need to recognize the extraordinary service of our security professionals. They are courageous
patriots and consummate professionals. And like you, I trust them with my life.
I want to thank Ambassador Pickering, Admiral Mullen, and all the members of the Accountability Review
Board. Their report takes a clear-eyed look at serious and systemic problems that we are already working to
fix. I have accepted every one of the Board's recommendations. I asked the Deputy Secretary for
Management and Resources to spearhead the effort to implement them, and to take those additional steps
above and beyond those recommendations that make sense and make us stronger. To do this well, we need
your help. All of us have to work together to take these reforms to heart and build on and improve the way
we do business.
I am determined to leave the State Department and USAID stronger, safer, and more secure than I found
them. I owe that to each of you. And I am delighted that President Obama has chosen Senator John Kerry to
continue that work. Earlier today, I spoke with John and congratulated him on his nomination to be the next
Secretary of State. I have been privileged to know him for many years, and to call him a friend, colleague, and
partner. He is the son of a career Foreign Service Officer, a decorated war hero, and an accomplished
statesman. I know that he shares our deep commitment to diplomacy and development. You deserve the
highest caliber leadership, and that is exactly what you'll get with Senator Kerry.","communityone","lundi","dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cembre","dmilledouze","philippereines","nowkend","wkfiftytwo","topic38","topic12","topic14",2565,38

MinDef and Minint in this way. The latter 2 are both very powerful by virtue of their Ziritan and lvlisrata roots
respectively, and any effort to remove them would have seriousblowback. MiniNt Fawzi who I saw the other day is
clearly way ahead of his colleague in getting the thuwar into the process of registration, the first step hopefully toward
DDR. I think everybody here is aware now how difficult the disarming of these militias, which have become de facto real
institutions in and of themselves. It is naieve to think they can be dissolved by executive fiat Some positive movement-
Jordanians preparing to accept first tranche of 1500 for police training.
There is concern here that continuing rivalries among the militias remains dangerous from the perspective of the havoc
they can wreak with their firepower and their continued control of select turf. At the end of the day, I think everybody is
coming to the conclusion that the elections will take place in the context of militia control. We hope that a program can
be devised to keep them acting responsibly toward the outcome of the election, especially viz the obligations they may
well be asked to undertake to keep elections free, and fair and devoid of violence. Always danger of continuing
skirmishes but Armageddon predictions a bit overstated.
We are all worried about the situation in Kufra and the clashes between the Arab alZwai tribe and the African tribe's the
Tebu. This is again a legacy of the Qadhafi era who played on these divisions to keep himself in control. The
government believes that the Tebu are being aided from al_Qadhafi elements and perhaps government supporters in
Sudan to undermine the TNC. There are some disturbing signs that in fact the TNC may be supporting the dispatch of
select militias to deploy down there maybe rpt maybe to ""resolve"" this ethnic problem as the situation in Tewarga was
resolved-i.e., ""ethnic cleansing"" --We are only at the very beginning stages of seeing whether there is credible evidence
on this score--so please rpt please don't raise any flags about it. It would be explosive.1 will keep you informed about any
info we develop.
No surprise about Heftat-he is extremely angry he lost out on the COS spot so his efforts to undermine the new COS
Mangoosh would be fully in line with his character to be big cheese.
The war wounded is a national tragedy. The former group allowed everybody to go abroad and they did to the tune of
800 million dollars. 50,000 Libyans abroad now 15 percent receiving medical treatment Who do you think the others
are? Relatives, frauds, and those who snuck out to get botox and tummy tucks. Senator McCain will rail about our

getting off to a strong start. I'm wound up about my concept of 21st century statecraft (and loved hearing those words
come out of HRC's mouth at NYU) and am wound up about the possibilities of government to people and people to
government communication as a way of revolutionizing statecraft and empowering people across the globe. I think this

Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless HandheldBrian, First, thanks for a nice family morning and for breakfast. Always fun, always interesting and always fulfilling.
Below is a sample of the kind of emails I sent to various people (studio heads; Dan Glickman; etc), which have started to
generate concern, interest and action. AJC is also active on other fronts, as well.
Just below the email you will find the news item which first called this abomination to my attention.
I hope you can enlist Hilary's support (and please give her my personal best). We need, for many reasons, to have the
US protest and condemn this outrageous boycott and to oppose the anti-Semitism inherent in it; cf Durban. The
organizers of the festival must be convinced to reverse themselves. This, because of the inherent wrongness of it and
that if it succeeds, it will encourage and motivate those who fomented the boycott to other, probably even worse,
action. For example, there is in effect or pending (I am not certain which) a UK-Israeli treaty on film production; we
should cut off at the pass any attempts to derail it.","communitythirteen","dimanche","mai","dmilleneuf","hillaryclinton","wkend","wktwentyone","topic7","topic27","topic25",1558,503

state. Obama had long wanted his former rival on his team, no matter what his friends and aides said about her
aggressive campaign... His staff opposed the idea for the most part, arguing that Clinton would never be truly loyal. But
Obama was willing to leave the primaries behind, including his own strong feelings at the time. ""I don't hold grudges,""
he told his aides. ""I don't worry about the past. I'm concerned about what happens now. If she can help me and Bill
Clinton isn't too much of a liability, we should seriously look at this."" ...
Obama was under no illusion about the legacy of the long primary season. During one transition meeting, Obama said he
wanted to offer Clinton the diplomatic job. ""I'm really interested in pursuing this, but I know she has some hard feelings
coming out of this campaign."" Emanuel and John Podesta, the former Clinton official who ran the transition, assured
Obama that she was over those hard feelings now. Obama smiled and said, ""Believe me. She's not over it yet.""
His decision to offer her the job of secretary of state came surprisingly early. Well before the end of the primaries, when
his staff and friends still felt hostile to her, Obama decided that Clinton possessed the qualities to carry his diplomacy to
the rest of the world. ""We actually thought during the primary, when we were pretty sure we were going to win, that
she could end up being a very effective secretary of state,"" he told me later. ""I felt that she was disciplined, that she was
precise, that she was smart as a whip, and that she would present a really strong image to the world...I had that mapped
out.""
Recruiting and managing a team of rivals would not be easy, and Clinton came with her own set of issues. Chief among
them was her campaign debt, which she wanted eliminated before she took the job of secretary of state. Would the
president-elect go out and help her to do so? ""I'm not begging her to take this job,"" Obama told his senior aides. ""If she
ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢wants it, I could help. But I'm not willing to go out in these difficult economic times to do a flashy fundraiser in
California."" As it happened, plenty of people in the Senate were begging Obama to offer Clinton the job. Obama's aides","communitythirteen","mardi","juin","dmilleneuf","hillaryclinton","nowkend","wktwentytwo","topic26","topic9","topic11",2426,503

He intends to fly mid-day so there will be plenty of time for more discussion over next several hours.

-- Resolution suspending Honduras passed with a roll call vote, requested by the Caribbeans, 33-0. Honduras did not
vote.
-- Strong push by key countries, including Mexico and Costa Rica, to try to convince Zelaya not to return today.
Zelaya seems intent on returning. If no other presidents travel with him, Insulza feels under an obligation to

An area where you could save time and space (but I didn't try to change it) would be to shorten the parts where you talk
about Israel and Palestine and about Iraq and Afghanistan - it seems to me that those are tactical discussions of an
existing issue, and somewhat removed from the more abstract and strategic policy outline she's otherwise aiming at

up the FY10 State/Foreign Ops Appropriations Bill at the earliest opportunity in SeptemberÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â to avoid the negative

As you know, if Senator Reid was able/willing to schedule time on the Senate floor there still remains a significant
obstacle. While the FY10 Bill had broad bipartisan support prior to markup, it now includes a controversial Lautenberg
amendment that would reverse the Mexico City policy statutorily. With Lautenberg's amendment in the Bill, procedural
hurdles are almost certain to lengthen and slow down floor action.
It is possible that an agreement could be reached to bring up the Bill and structure votes so that the Republicans could
offer amendments including one to strike Lautenberg's language.
Should you agree to ask the Secretary to make such a call I would imagine she would want to get views from Jack Lew,
Pat Kennedy, Rich Greene, and Rich Verma, first.","communitythirteen","lundi","septembre","dmilleneuf","hillaryclinton","nowkend","wkthirtysix","topic15","topic32","topic21",1189,503

See if you can find a way to clear her mind of all the terrifying thoughts

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday alerted the countrymen to the
ongoing conspiracy of 'special quarter' and 'undemocratic forces' who are
still plotting to wipe out democracy and grab the seat in power after
being failed to capture it.
The prime minister, however, urged the Leader of the Opposition and BNP
Chairperson Khaleda Zia and her allies to return to parliament for raising
their voices.
Recalling her experience as the opposition leader, Hasina said, ""We used

We in London are extremely excited for Secretary Clinton's visit. Hopefully if you join her we will have a few minutes to
get together. The purpose of this e-mail is to bring you up to date on my decision regarding the potential employment
of as my Schedule C assistant. I met two times with and the meetings confirmed everything
you said as to her capabilities, intelligence and personality. My conclusion at the end of the meetings was that
was so overqualified for the position we need to fill. It would be like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and it
would end up not working out for either of us. Our needs are 80% administrative, evidenced by our position description
which is attached.
I believe that understood my difficulties in attempting to have a Special Assistant with her skills. That being said,
I definitely want to use her capabilities and create a relationship not only personally, but with the Embassy in the future.
I have appointed her to which she was very excited about. I am in the process of
looking for special projects in the Embassy and to make introductions to major corporations who may be able to use her
skills in the private sector. I am attaching her e-mail to me, which speaks for itself.

As you will see, the beginning of this memo lays out 4 strategic interests, 3 of which overlap with the goals we discussed
in our conversation; the fourth goes to the international consequences of success or failure.
Assuming we go with the approach we discussed, a cover memo should work reasonably well with this document
(excepting the discussion on the foreign aid piece). See if you agree.

Pakistan's government can sure use the help. I'd like you to talk w Judith McHale who is working w Holbrooke's team,

Pls let me know what the next steps are w Amb Haqqani. Thanks too for your other work on global women's issues.
Best, HHello Madame Secretary. I hope you have a productive trip to Pakistan. I wanted to let you know that Ambassador
Haqqani asked me to submit a proposal to help the Government of Pakistan strengthen its communications with the
Pakistani public.
You may recall that my firm did similar hands-on work in Lebanon. The idea is to enhance the Government's internal
capacity to raise public awareness of its accomplishments, build support for its policies, and demonstrate the benefits of
democratic governance.
With stronger communications, they'd obviously be in a better position to convey the benefits of the US-Pakistan
relationship. We've followed Pakistani media coverage of Kerry-Lugar -- with more strategic communications
management by the Government, that could have been a positive story.
(The anti-American forces have used the same messages to attack US aid packages for at least 10 years. It was easy to
see the attacks coming.)
Communications help won't solve the immediate political crisis, but it could be one useful element of a larger strategic
communications strategy.","communitythirteen","lundi","novembre","dmilleneuf","hillaryclinton","nowkend","wkfortyfour","topic1","topic11","topic16",1441,503

Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and Ricardo
Lagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.
We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we
have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo
Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt
about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.
You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its
America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did
the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He
and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.
Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify
further opportunities for your engagement.Tom and Craig--
I spoke w Secretary Solis and thanked her for going to Honduras. She is eager for your briefing and advice when you
meet w her today. And it is very important that Craig is going w her to guide her thru this process.
Oscar Arias told me he is very worried about whether the agreement will be implemented and is meeting w the
leading Presidential candidate this week to urge that he produce his party's 55 votes for restitution.
I also spoke w Insulza who is focussed on the elections which I told him we would fully support. Is there more we
should be doing?

There are 4 seat in the Eisenhower that are complimentary and then 4 that would need to be purchased for nominal fee

Has Cameron done a deal with Murdoch?
By Andy McSmith
Lord Mandelson's attack shines spotlight on Tory leader's links with media mogul
David Cameron has been accused of making a ""contract"" with Britain's biggest media company to trade political support
before an election for government favours afterwards if the Tories win.
The accusation was levelled yesterday by the Business Secretary Peter Mande!son, who is increasingly the public face of
Gordon Brown's government. Ministers are angry at the campaign that The Sun has run against the Prime Minister all
this week over the spelling mistakes in a letter Mr Brown sent to the mother of a young soldier killed in Afghanistan.
They suspect that the Conservative Party has been tailoring its policies on media regulation and the BBC to suit the
commercial interests of News International, which owns The Sun, and that the paper's aggressive support for the Tories
is a pay-off that could spread to other parts of the mass media.
Examples of the apparent tie-in between what News International's boss, James Murdoch, wants, and what David
Cameron is ready to promise include the recent decision by the Conservatives to abandon the idea of ""top slicing"" the
BBC licence fee. It had been proposed that part of the money paid to the BBC would be siphoned off to help regional
television companies meet the threat from the Internet. But this would also have helped them compete more effectively
against Sky News, which is part of the Murdoch media empire.
When the policy was abandoned in September, Jeremy Hunt, the shadow Culture Secretary, said that it was because
enacting it might make the commercial television companies ""focus not on attracting viewers but on attracting
subsidies"". There was no gain for the BBC in the climbdown, because David Cameron had already said that the Tories will
freeze the licence fee. What it will mean is that the BBC's income will be capped, without the regional television
companies seeing any government help, which will strengthen the market position of Britain's only satellite television
company, Sky. ""This was done for News International,"" a Tory insider said yesterday. ""Murdoch wants Sky to go head to
head with the BBC. He doesn't want the independent companies strengthened.""
In April 2008, James Murdoch complained bitterly about the media regulator Ofcom in his first major speech after taking
over as chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia. The following year, David Cameron announced that a
Conservative government would cut Ofcom down to size.

First, some background. Mexico requested a WTO panel to resolve its tuna/dolphin dispute with the United
States U.S. measures prohibit Mexican tuna from being labeled ""dolphin safe"" even though the tuna is
harvested in accordance with the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program. However,
dolphin population recovery has not occurred as rapidly as expected under that Program. Despite the measures,
Mexico exported about $18 million worth of tuna to the United States in 2007.

The OSCE's broad geographical coverage and the span of issues ranging from technical arms control treaties to foreign
policy and human rights challenges in the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Russia, Caucasus and Central Asia requires in-depth
knowledge of all aspects of American foreign policy, plus an ability to respond to rapidly changing circumstances during
open mutlilateral debates and in negotiations on international agreement and treaties. It also requires rapid intervention in
emerging crisis situations, such as potential regional conflict flashpoints in the Caucasus, Central Asia or the
Balkans. The PermRep to the OSCE is also responsible for overseeing OSCE operations in 18 countries of Europe and
Central Asia, while overseeing a staff of 30 professionals in Vienna and an additional 50 Americans seconded to OSCE
Missions and field offices spread from Tirana to Tashkent. The briefing memo endorsed by Secretary Clinton on
""Revitalizing the OSCE"" noted the importance of assigning a strong Ambassador to this key position -- a need that is only
heightened as it appears the Organization is about to embark on a multi-year major strategic review and negotiation of
principles and mechanisms to underpin European security architecture. Thus, the Ambassador to the U.S. Mission to the
OSCE will also have to be very sensitive to negotiations and trends elsewhere in Europe, including in a bilateral US-
Russian track, in NATO, and in US-EU relations, as well as overseeing negotiations to revive conventional arms control in
the European theater. In-depth knowledge of the former Soviet Union region and Russian language skills are a major
plus for the Permanent Representative, as this is a primary forum for interaction with Russia and Central Asian countries
on a daily basis. Strong public speaking skills are also a must, as the U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE is expected to
speak on the record in hundreds of public statements each year on issues of concern to two different regional bureaus
(EUR and SCA) and four functional bureaus (VCI, DRL, EB, and RPM).Cheryl

counts 6 permanent staff. We really need an office on the 7th floor, with representational space, as I will be bringing in
CEO's, Foundation presidents, and other prominent individuals on a range of isues, and they'll need to know that, the
Secretary takes these public/private initiatives seriously.
There is some good space on the 7th floor (suite 7427 has been vacated by the CFO and would be perfect), and there
might also be extra space in the newly renovated old wing, where Judith McHale and R will be moving. In any event, I
plan to hit the ground running on June 1, so I'll need a secretary and office asap, as I'm in effect coming into State every
day anyway, but Pat won't make a move without your authorization.
Many thanks!

Berlusconi had asked that each donor country ""adopt"" a damaged cultural heritage monument, but EUR seems to think
that the Italians would welcome the U.S. initiative which might include help in repairing physical damage to the
University itself but would concentrate primarily on development of human capital. One of Ambassador Bagley's
suggestions was that we work with the Italian Ambassador here, who is well connected to the Prime Minister, to ensure
a positive Italian response.Is this what the Italians want though?Cheryl,
Ambassador Bagley and Kris joined representatives from EUR and ECA today to review where things stand with
respect to launching a public/private partnership in response to PM Berlusconi's appeal to the President. EUR and ECA
will be sending up today a follow-up action memo to the Secretary asking that she approve in principle a partnership in
conjunction with the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) that would focus largely on raising money for
academic exchanges for students from L'Aquila University, the school of higher education most affected by the
earthquake. This is not exactly the monument rebuilding that PM Berlusconi initially proposed, but it is something very
much in keeping with our mission and of interest to NIAF. Ambassador Bagley and Kris had a number of suggestions that
will help EUR and ECA as we move forward especially in selecting the right people to help with fund raising and making
sure the Italian Government welcomes this initiative. DanUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F!2014-20439 Doc No. C05761178 Date: 06/30/2015","communitytwelve","lundi","mai","dmilleneuf","cherylmills","nowkend","wkeighteen","topic22","topic34","topic3",1666,362

WASHINGTON ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â It is not every 31-year-old who, in a first government job, finds himself dismantling General Motors
and rewriting the rules of American capitalism.
But that, in short, is the job description for Brian Deese, a not-quite graduate of Yale Law School who had never set foot
in an automotive assembly plant until he took on his nearly unseen role in remaking the American automotive industry.
Nor, for that matter, had he given much thought to what ailed an industry that had been in decline ever since he was
born. A bit laconic and looking every bit the just-out-of-graduate-school student adjusting to life in the West Wing ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â
""he's got this beard that appears and disappears,"" says Steven Rattner, one of the leaders of President Obama's
automotive task force ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â Mr. Deese was thrown into the auto industry's maelstrom as soon the election-night parties
ended.
""There was a time between Nov. 4 and mid-February when I was the only full-time member of the auto task force,"" Mr.
Deese, a special assistant to the president for economic policy, acknowledged recently as he hurried between his desk at
the White House and the Treasury building next door. ""It was a little scary.""
But now, according to those who joined him in the middle of his crash course about the automakers' downward spiral,
he has emerged as one of the most influential voices in what may become President Obama's biggest experiment yet in
federal economic intervention.
While far more prominent members of the administration are making the big decisions about Detroit, it is Mr. Deese
who is often narrowing their options.
A month ago, when the administration was divided over whether to support Fiat's bid to take over much of Chrysler, it
was Mr. Deese who spoke out strongly against simply letting the company go into liquidation, according to several
people who were present for the debate.

""espionage"" did not appear in the KCNA report. I also mentioned that we were not aware of recent cases where
previously detained Amcits in the DPRK were ""indicted"" and ""brought to trial."" I said I wouldn't read too much into
terms such as ""illegal entry"" and ""suspected hostile acts""; I was still convinced that the track we've been pursuing, i.e.
gaining consular access through the Swedish Amb. in Pyongyang, and contact via other diplomatic channels, offered
hope for a resolution.
Mr. Gore said he very much appreciated the call. He asked that we convey as much of this information as we could to
the family members. I told him we would do so through CA.Here's the KCNA just in from OSC:
Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The illegal entry of U.S. reporters into the
DPRK and their suspected hostile acts have been confirmed by evidence and their
statements, according to the results of intermediary investigation conducted by a competent
organ of the DPRK.

given benefits similar to those that their heterosexual counterparts enjoy, U.S. officials said Saturday.
In a notice to be sent soon to State Department employees, Clinton says regulations that denied same-sex couples and
their families the same rights and privileges that straight diplomats enjoyed are ""unfair and must end,"" as they harm U.S.
diplomacy.
""Providing training, medical care and other benefits to domestic partners promote the cohesiveness, safety and
effectiveness of our posts abroad,"" she says in the message, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.
""It will also help the department attract and retain personnel in a competitive environment where domestic partner
benefits and allowances are increasingly the norm for world-class employers,"" she says.
""At bottom, the department will provide these benefits for both opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partners because
it is the right thing to do,"" Clinton says.","communityeleven","samedi","mai","dmilleneuf","humaabedin","wkend","wktwentyone","topic12","topic34","topic19",1156,373

FYIFolks,
You may recall an April 17 Post story on problems with Dyncorps in Afghanistan which focused on a suspected
drug overdose death, breakdown in internal controls within the company, and actions the USG and the firm
were taking. The other issue that surfaced at the time was a colossal error in judgment by one of the
contractors' employees in hiring an adolescent boy dancer for some sort of event that, at least to most folks,
looked very inappropriate. The Post is now looking at the dancing boy, which was not included in the April 17,
article, and we expect will soon publish a story on it.
The Post inquiry at this point focuses only on confirming whether or not there's an OIG investigation. We are,
of course, referring the Post to the OIG on such a question. However, the premise for the question raises the
issue again in some eye-popping rhetoric which could feature in the follow-up story, so I wanted to make sure
everyone had a heads-up.
We have already relieved the folks involved with both incidents and I am meeting with the firm's CEO today to
hear his report on his trip to Afghanistan and Iraq to address these, as well as other, issues on which we have
demanded corrective actions.
I'm attaching the original note to Deputy Secretary Lew at the time of the original inquiry which lays out both
issues, a copy of the memo the INL section at Embassy Kabul provided to Post Management on the most
recent Post inquiry, as well as the Post inquiry itself for context.

The film festival returned funds that it had received from the Israeli Embassy, after protests from some UK film figures
(Ken Loach) and Palestinian solidarity groups.
The Israeli director is now being funded directly by the festival.
The organizers issued a sort of apology today.
We have not been able to locate any State Dept response to similar episodes in the past (Israeli academics disinvited to
a British conference).Pls read Brian's message and all the email traffic below. What can we do about this? Let me know if you have ideas. Thx.Hi hillary,
Please call me about this if you have a moment. The message is self-explanatory, apparently there is no american voice
in place to speak out or lead on this issue so --there is no voice. I believe you know Bruce Ramer who is my brother-in-
law, former president of american jewish committee and well-respected entertainment lawyer in la. And, he is right.
Look forward to seeing you next week in washington. Best, brian
12Brian, First, thanks for a nice family morning and for breakfast. Always fun, always interesting and always fulfilling.
Below is a sample of the kind of emails I sent to various people (studio heads; Dan Glickman; etc), which have started to
ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ generate concern, interest and action. AJC is also active on other fronts, as well.
Just below the email you will find the news item which first called this abomination to my attention.
I hope you can enlist Hilary's support (and please give her my personal best). We need, for many reasons, to have the
US protest and condemn this outrageous boycott and to oppose the anti-Semitism inherent in it; cf Durban. The
organizers of the festival must be convinced to reverse themselves. This, because of the inherent wrongness of it and
that if it succeeds, it will encourage and motivate those who fomented the boycott to other, probably even worse,
action. For example, there is in effect or pending (I am not certain which) a UK-Israeli treaty on film production; we
should cut off at the pass any attempts to derail it.
Our Embassy in London does not yet have our Ambassador. The charge d'affaires is Robert Lebaron who I hope will
receive appropriate instructions from DOS. If he acts quickly, it is likely that other nations will follow suit; again,
compare Durban.
This is truly appalling and serious and I earnestly solicit your assistance with the Secretary, and through you my earnest
solicitation of her assistance.
With appreciation and love, Bruce
PS Naturally, you are free to share this email.
Dear Michael, This is disgusting and outrageous.
If you have any films in the festival or can lean on anyone else who does, please get them withdrawn. We would not
boycott the films of any other nation, even those we consider outlaws. Neither should they. And they should learn that
boycotts beget boycotts.
Thanks for whatever help you can be.
Warmest regards. Bruce

I won't soon forget the thrill of supporting our US Olympic family, the President and other Americans
during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympic Games. We can be proud to have safely and securely
consolidated employees at our beautiful new embassy where proximity to colleagues and techno wizardry
have catalyzed collaboration in our professional efforts. To that list we can now add our contributions to
the engagement with China of a new U.S. administration through mutual efforts to build a positive,
cooperative and comprehensive bilateral relationship. Your accomplishments are too numerous to mention
in more detail, but the depth, breadth and excellence of our agencies and posts in China are acclaimed as
without equal among U.S. diplomatic missions.
Just as important have been successes in improving work-life balance throughout the Mission, in
facilitating employment of our family members, and in promoting the sense of community and mutual
support among employees, sections, and agencies as well as with constituent and neighboring posts.
I am hopeful that some have noticed the effort to provide deserving officers, specialists, family members
and LES employees with opportunities for professional growth including in supervisory and leadership
roles. Because of the ever-increasing diversity and talent of our team, the exit of any one colleague has
never diluted our combined strength nor caused us or the Department concern. I am therefore confident
that we will manage the many transitions we'll address in the coming months with exceptional
competence and that we can count on each others' support as we prepare for new leadership throughout","communitytwelve","jeudi","mai","dmilleneuf","cherylmills","nowkend","wktwenty","topic40","topic25","topic3",1806,362

Commerce, the Committee of 100, and others). We are getting a de-brief on their plans and new structure tomorrow.
In our calls to GE's Jeff Immelt, the Chamber, and others we learned that it would not be viable to get 20 CEO's into
Washington with such short notice. The Secretary called us in last Friday and said that she was game for doing some
additional calls which everyone in the business community thinks is a more efficient way to get this done. We are
holding a meeting on Friday with the business community (up to 75 Washington reps) and would follow it up with
individual assignments. We could still build an event with CEOs around late July Strategic Dialogue.
We will get you a more detailed plan with all of the potential events and assignments.Kris/Elizabeth:
Not sure if I missed your email or hard copy but was looking for a plan memo on Friday for this that I wanted to share
with S.
Can you advise on status?

Is this another Iranian revolution?
To someone who has watched and studied the Iranian revolution of 1979 with fascination, developments
in Iran today have an eerie reminiscence. Then there were massive protests that filled the streets, often
marching in dignified but ominous silence; there was bloodshed as nervous security men with guns faced
determined but unarmed crowds; there were sullen mourning parades;20there were catchy chants and
ritual calls of ""Down with the shah!""; at night the rooftops rang with shouts of allahu akbar.
You need only change ""shah"" to ""dictator,"" and you have a description of what is happening in Iran
today.
But there is one very big difference. Thirty years ago, Iran had a charismatic cleric named Ayatollah
Khomeini who had a refined sense of strategy and a willingness to risk everything for the cause he
represented. On the other side was Mohammed Reza Shah, who had been on the throne for some 37
years and who commanded one of the most powerful military and security regimes in the world. On the
surface it appeared to be an uneven battle ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â guns against turbans ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â but the ruler with the guns wavered
and the turbans grew in size and confidence until the old order collapsed.
Today the nominal leader of the opposition forces is a reformed radical, Mir Hossein Mousavi, who is
notably lacking in personal charisma. On the other side is the constitutional Leader, Ayatollah
IChamene' i, who is widely perceived as a cautious political animal with limited qualifications for his
religious post and who compensates for his own lack of charisma by manipulation of the political system
and the institutions most loyal to him ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â particularly the politically minded clergy and the powerful
security forces, including the Revolutionary Guards.
Neither of these men seems to be fully in control of their own forces, let alone the situation. The
fraudulent election defeat of Mousavi was a triggering event, but the energy behind these unprecedented
demonstrations is due more to the sense of outrage and betrayal at the gross manipulation of numbers by
the regime than it is about any undying devotion to Mousavi. Yesterday Mousavi ordered that people
stay home in face of a conflicting pro-regime demonstration. They marched anyway (and the daughter of
former president Rafsanjani joined them and urged them on). Mousavi then ""ordered"" everyone to
march the following day (which they were probably going to do with or without his orders).
IChamene'i announced the ""divine assessment"" of the election outcome ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â even before it would probably
have been physically possible to count the more than 40 million ballots. Then, in the face of mass protests,
he ordered an investigation of the results by the Guardian CouncilÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â the same organization that was
responsible for managing the election in the first place. No one believed him in either case, and no one
expected anything of importance from the Guardian Council. Khamene'i has ordered peace and
reconciliation. No one paid any attention.
I deliberately did not mention president-elect Ahmadinejad. After celebrating his ""victory,"" he went off
to a largely symbolic meeting in Moscow. He seems to be out of the decision loop and more of a passive
player than a major actor in these events.
So who is calling the shots? Mousavi seems to be running along after the crowd, not leading it. But that is
probably all that is required to keep the protest in motion.","communitytwelve","jeudi","juin","dmilleneuf","sidneyblumenthal","nowkend","wktwentyfive","topic38","topic24","topic13",3983,94

Day of Mourning, Protests, Called by Mousavi on Thursday
Mir-Hosain Mousavi, who maintains he won last Friday's presidential election despite official assertions that he
lost 2 to 1 to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is calling for another rally Thursday, this time in part to honor the
persons killed by hardliners or security forces in the course of previous demonstrations.
Mourning the martyr is as central to Iranian Shiite religious culture as it was to strains of medieval Catholicism
in Europe, and Mousavi's camp is tapping into a powerful set of images and myths here. The archetypal Shiite
martyr is Imam Husayn, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, who championed oppressed Muslims in Iraq
and was cut down by the then Umayyad Muslim Empire. Redognition that a Muslim state might commit the
ultimate in sacrilege by beheading a person who had been dangled on the Prophet's knee has imbued modern
political Shiism with a distrust of the state. When Husayn's head was brought to the Umayyad caliph Yazid and
deposited before his throne, older companions of the Prophet are said to have wept and remarked, ""I saw the
Prophet's lips on those cheeks."" Shiites ritually march, flagellate, and chant in honor of the martyred Imam or
divinely-appointed leader.
Today's protesters are wearing green, which symbolizes Mousavi's descent from the Prophet Muhammad.
(Mousavi's family name refers to the Seventh Imam (descendant of the Prophet with claims to divine
knowledge), Musa Kazim, whose tomb is in Kazimiya, north Baghdad. Sayyid families, those claiming descent
from the Prophet, often take one of the Imams' names as a family name to honor them, though of course they
are also claiming descent from the previous Imams right back to the Prophet.) The repertoires of protest the
reformists are using echo those of the 1978-79 Islamic Revolution-- they are chanting ""God is Great,"" mourning
pious fallen martyrs, etc.-- another sign that this movement is not just alienated secularized elites.
But now Mousavi's his supporters are also sporting black ribbons to indicate that they are in mourning for the
fallen. Typically, the dead will be commemorated again at one month and at 40 days. In 1978 such
demonstrations for those killed in previous demonstrations grew in size all through the year, till they reached an
alleged million in the streets of Tehran. Since the reformists are already claiming Monday's rally was a million,
you wonder where things will go from here.
The regime's attempt to paint the protesters as nothing more than US intelligence agents underlines how wise
President Obama has been not to insert himself forcefully into the situation in Iran. The reformers and the hard
liners are not stable groupings. The core of each is competing for the allegiance of the general Iranian public. If
the reformers can convince most Iranians of the justice of their cause, they will swing behind the opposition. If
the hard liners can convince the public that the reformers are nothing more than cat's paws of a grasping,
imperialist West-- i.e. that they are Ahmad Chalabis trying to bring Iran foreign occupation so as to get power
themselves-- then the reformists will be crushed. Iranians value national independence above all, having
suffered with a CIA-installed goverment for decades in the mid-twentieth century.

of being crown prince restricted his life, education and travel. I suspect the reason he's done this is so his son can be
properly groomed from now to inherit the thrown. Life will change dramatically for him.What's Hussein like?Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.
Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) he
has clear authority to do it.1 personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcry
from his fathers loyalists.What does this mean?(SBU) Embassy Amman reports a royal decree was issued naming HRH Prince Hussein Ben Abdullah as Crown Prince as
of today.","communityeleven","jeudi","juillet","dmilleneuf","humaabedin","nowkend","wktwentyseven","topic12","topic39","topic5",932,373

Sent via BlackBerry by AT&TBill Clinton raising bucks for Maloney
Former President Clinton will be keeping his commitment to host a fundraiser for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who
has irritated other Democratic leaders by announcing she*s challenging Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in a
primary.
The July 20 fundraiser with Clinton*in Manhattan had been in the works for months, well before Maloney
announced she would be running against Gillibrand. The former president has not endorsed in the race for his
wife*s former Senate seat and is not planning to issue an endorsement, according to his spokesman.
Clinton held a fundraiser for Gillibrand in March soon after she was appointed to the Senate by Gov. David
Paterson (D-N.Y).
The fundraiser is for Maloney*s House fund but in practical terms, the fundraiser has the same effect as raising
money for a Senate campaign. Maloney is allowed to transfer unlimited sums from her House campaign
account to any future Senate account, according to FEC law.
Clinton spokesman Matt McKenna said the fundraiser is part of a series of events where the former president is
helping out elected officials who supported his wife*s 2008 presidential campaign.
*We agreed to do this event some time ago, as a way of saying thank you for the congresswoman*s hard
work on behalf of then-Sen. Clinton in the presidential campaign* said McKenna.
But Clinton is steering clear from helping another Hillary-supporting House Democrat who is also challenging a
sitting senator in a primary. POLITICO reported last month that Clinton wont be holding any fundraisers for
Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Pa.), a Clinton pal who is running against Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pa.).
Specter has been endorsed by President Obama, Vice President Biden and Gov. Ed Rendell (D-Pa.), who was
also one of Hillary*s most dedicated supporters in 2008.","communitytwelve","jeudi","juillet","dmilleneuf","cherylmills","nowkend","wktwentyseven","topic32","topic13","topic15",1847,362

The bottom line of all of them was not dissimiliar to this message from torn so forwarding this one - namely, all had been
unsuccessful in dissuading Zeleya from going today and several leaders and fm (espinoza) thought call from you might
help but Zeleya appeared in update messages to get more resolute as evening went on to return based upon readouts of
various meetings with him.

I just got off the phone with President Fernandez. His efforts to dissuade Zelaya and Company from traveling tomorrow
have not been successful. He was very worried about what would happen, and requested our help in ensuring that no
incidents take place at the airport.
I told him I shared his concern. I summarized for him our efforts to date, and told him that nascent engagement with
the armed forces and the de facto government would collapse if Zelaya tried to force the issue tomorrow. I told him of
the Cardinal's plea to Zelaya to not return. He said the Cardinal in Santo Domingo is close to the Honduran Cardinal, and
said he would reach out to him. I encouraged this. I told him that I thought the elements of a deal were on the table,
we just needed to find a way to get everyone to sit at the table and start talking. I told President Fernandez that he
could play an important role in creating a climate of confidence, and suggested that he reach out to interested parties
like Ricardo Maduro and others inside of Honduras. He said he would do so and get back to me

CdmUpdate:
-- Resolution suspending Honduras passed with a roll call vote, requested by the Caribbeans, 33-0. Honduras did not
vote.
-- Strong push by key countries, including Mexico and Costa Rica, to try to convince Zelaya not to return today.
Zelaya seems intent on returning. If no other presidents travel with him, Insulza feels under an obligation to
accompany.

WDC at approx 1500 WDC time. Also understand that plane is expected in Managua at approx 1924 local. Understand
that a separate plane with Argentine Pres Kirchner and Ecuadorian Pres. Correa also left WDC this afternoon en route to
El Salvador.
NEW INFORMATION
About 45 minutes ago, Telesur had images of apparent pro-Zelaya supporters at the airport fence and trying to pull it
down. Security forces inside the airport compound re-deployed to prevent a breach. It seems they did use white smoke
or gas to deter protestor action. Telesur also reported that shots were fired into the assembled crowd and that one or
two people were shot and killed (no names or confirmation). Images of ambulances in crowd were visible.
It seems now that the fence has been breached and a handful of pro-Zelaya supporters move in and out of airport area
to pick up rocks and retreat (there is open, clear area inside fence, possible construction). Security forces have taken up
positions on tarmac, presumably to prevent further incursion.
With respect to Micheleti assertion that NIC troops have mobilized near the border, our NIC contacts, both in GON and
private citizens indicate that there has been NO/NO unusual NIC mil activity at border -- Las Manos or El Espino.
However, as of 1900 Saturday, border contacts at El Espino report that HOND military reinforced its presence by about
70 personnel, who remain at El Espino. We were told this happened at Las Manos as well, but have not yet been able to
confirm with our sources at that border location.
Will continue to monitor and observe.

I owe you both an apology. I had a very productive flight (8-10 hours in a darkened quiet cabin is just what I needed) and
finished Les Gelb's book -- it is astonishing how close our analyses are -- he says that foundation of US power is to
catalyze others to get problems solved. HRC wanted me to make the speech harder and I see some very good ways to do
that -- talking about assembling power coalitions to deal w/ troublesome states, a term Les uses.
But I also had a chance to reread the frame that you put together, much more carefully. There are a number of very
good things in it that I am going to try to work into a revision, or at least flag for how we can build off of this speech in
subsequent speeches. I am sorry that I didn't see that in the press of trying to get to this point.
I will have a revision by Sunday afternoon China time, which would allow her and you to see it Sunday morning.

Dear Senator Lautenberg,
I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you this past weekend regarding the custody case of Sean Goldman, the
young American boy wrongfully detained in Brazil for more than five years. As we discussed, the Administration has
long maintained that Sean should be reunited with his father David in New Jersey. I have made a point of emphasizing
this position with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim during our many conversations, as have other U.S. Officials
with their Brazilian counterparts.
We have worked closely with the Government of Brazil to ensure it upholds its obligations under the Hague Convention
on International Child Abduction. We were quite concerned by last week's decision suspending the order reuniting Sean
with his father. We were encouraged, however, by the appeal filed last Friday by the Brazilian Solicitor General which
challenges this suspension. Like you, we are eager to learn of the outcome of this appeal. We understand a decision
could be announced shortly.
You can be assured that we will continue advocating for the reunification of Sean and his father and pressing the
Government of Brazil to ensure swift consideration of the Goldman case so that this long legal process may reach a final
conclusion without further delay. In the meantime, please be assured that the State Department as well as the U.S.
Embassy in Brasilia has been and will continue to be a resource to the Goldman family during this trying time.","communitythirteen","mardi","dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cembre","dmilleneuf","hillaryclinton","nowkend","wkfiftyone","topic15","topic27","topic23",2204,503

Authority, the office responsible for Hague Convention abduction cases. You will see that in spite of our efforts to
protect the son, the Brazilian family chose to make a spectacle outside the Consulate this morning by parading Sean
through a crowd. Ms. Lamego recently visited the U.S. where she met with members of Congress and others to explain
all that the Brazilian Central Authority was doing to reunite Sean and his father under the Hague Convention. The
delays we saw in this case were largely the result of a wealthy, well connected family able to influence court decisions.
We are all relieved and thrilled to see this long overdue but very happy ending. I should also highlight the amazing
work done by US Mission Brazil. The consular staff, Charge, Acting DCM (Marie Damour, the Consul General in Brasilia),
LegATT, RSO, and a host of others all played a role in this successful return. My OCS DAS, Michele Bond, and her
dedicated team also played a big role in communicating with David, his lawyers, Congress, and the press. We had

B6Importance: High
Dear All,
The Goldman case finally came to an end, and despite the efforts of all involved the hand over of the child to the US
Consulate in Rio was transformed into a deplorable display of the child walking in the streets with the maternal family,
being exposed to the media and to the public that surrounded the consulate.
I'm sorry this had to happen but it seems that Mr. Sergio Tostes, the maternal family's attorney, did not feel at all
embarrased to use and expose the child, who was probably under severe stress, in order to gather support for his
position. This most despicable man is not accepting the fact that, despite his life long relationships with influential
authorities in Brazil, he was unable to win the case and Sean is finally being reunited with his only real father.
I just hope that David and the Goldman family find enough time to recover their lives and their relationship with Sean.
They need time more than anything else and now it is up to the US government to guarantee that David Goldman will","communitythirteen","jeudi","dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cembre","dmilleneuf","hillaryclinton","nowkend","wkfiftytwo","topic23","topic4","topic5",2509,503

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has consulted with a surprisingly diverse ideological bunch in the course of

Hillary is set to deliver her high-profile speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, and is set to articulate her

reportedly has.

providing an additional directly to Treasury for the multilateral food initiative. This means that of the

minute issue if the percentages get out of alignment.
In terms of policy this has all of the restorations to initiatives that we discussed last week and also adds to

restore the proposal to increase in State and USAID staffing. While the staff increases will be funded at 50 percent of

Angola pledges $1.2 bin to farming, food security
LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola will invest an estimated $1.2 billion in agricultural development over
the next four years as part of a food security initiative, according to a government statement
published on Thursday.
The investment will be financed by a line of credit from the China Development Bank, private
investment and other loans, said the statement in the state-owned newspaper Jornal de Angola.
The plan is to take advantage of Angola's natural resources and bolster employment, the
government said. Angola was once a major food exporter but a 27-year civil war that ended in
2002 devastated the sector.
""The project also aims to guarantee food security, supply the internal market and take
advantage of local, regional and international 'opportunities,"" the statement said.
Angola, the world's fourth biggest coffee producer and a top exporter of sugarcane, bananas,
sisal and cotton before the 1975-2002 civil war, now imports much of its food from abroad.
This has helped push inflation in the capital Luanda to 13.95 percent year-on-year in June,
frustrating government plans to reduce it to 12.5 percent by the end of the year.
Luanda is also considered the world's most expensive city for foreigners, a study by London-
based human resources consultants ECA recently showed.

Observations
1. There is a considerable change in Indonesian attitudes toward the United States. The latest Pew Global Polls
indicate a 73% approval level; the last time it was nearly this level was only in the wake of the generous help
provided after the Tsunami disaster. Higher education officials warmly welcomed our trip and, more importantly,
are eager to increase student flows to America and institutional partnerships between U.S. and Indonesian
universities. The Director General for Higher Education (DGHE) has been given a special budget to promote this,
seven leading schools have been given special budgets by DGHE to explore partnerships, and the Ministry will
support a delegation of leading Indonesian educators and Rectors to visit the U.S. sometime in late fall/early
winter.
2. The Delegation represented over 30 colleges and universities arrived only 9 days after the terrorist bombing of
two hotels in Jakarta, which meant our Indonesian hosts deeply appreciated the show of solidarity we made by
coming. During our visit, the White House announced that President Obama would come to Jakarta in
November. The U.S. Ambassador arranged for the entire Country Team to brief us on our first day; we saw him
and his senior staff three more times during the week for substantive meetings, and he attended the farewell
dinner given by the Minister of Education. We were also scheduled to be received by President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono (SBY), who had to cancel at the last minute due to the onset of flu. Earlier in the week we were
hosted by his Spokesman.
3. Nearly every Indonesian senior official with whom we met had been educated in the United States. But many of
the officials just below that level had not had this chance. Some characterized this cohort as a lost generation
and the senior officials all spoke about providing opportunities for this group now (through a ""re-charging"" program
that the Government will fund) for short term study visits and about making sure that the next generation will now
have the chances that the most senior group once did to come to America for especially graduate education.
4. Indonesia, the 4th most populous country in the world, is the sixteenth-leading country of origin for students
coming to the U.S.; number 15 is Hong Kong (8200 students). A little more than 7600 Indonesians are currently
enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities. This is approximately half the number that were enrolled a decade
ago. The decline began in the wake of the Asian Economic Crisis of 1997 and accelerated after 2001 when there
were substantial visa issues and problems ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â coupled to a growing perception by Indonesians that America was an
unfriendly and not very welcoming country, especially for Muslims. At the same time, major campaigns were
launched by the governments of Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, China, Germany and the Netherlands to recruit
Indonesian students; today there are over 20,000 Indonesians studying in Australia alone. The appeal of these
countries also stems from the relative ease of applying to non-US higher education institutions and the willingness

given a top US official an initial readout on his North Korea trip and plans to conduct a more formal and in-depth
debriefing for the White House, officials said Thursday.Clinton spoke to a member of President Barack Obama's national
security council on Wednesday night, hours after flying home from negotiating the release of two jailed US journalists,
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said.""We are going to get a fuller briefing,"" Gibbs said, adding that Obama was
also seeking to sit down with the former president to get a rare view from at the inner workings of Kim Jong-II's hermetic
political system.The White House has so far declined to detail the nature of Clinton's conversations, other than to style
the visit as a purely humanitarian mission that included no message from Obama to the leadership in Pyongyang.The
Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Clinton discussed a broad range of issues in a three-hour encounter with Kim,
and told him Pyongyang could benefit if it released kidnapped South Korean and Japanese nationals.The paper quoted a
South Korean official as saying Kim was hoping to secure the kind of direct summit with Obama that he failed to lock in
with the former president as his administration drew to a close in 2000 and 2001.A day after Obama told North Korea it
must halt provocative acts and its nuclear program, Gibbs argued that the next step in any easing of tensions must come
from Pyongyang.""If they would like to see a greater international breakthrough, then they just have to come back to live
up to the responsibilities that they entered into,"" he said.""We are going to continue to ensure that we take actions to
enforce recently passed Security Council resolutions to ensure there is not the proliferation of weapons of mass","communityeleven","jeudi","aoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»t","dmilleneuf","humaabedin","nowkend","wkthirtytwo","topic19","topic15","topic24",1910,373

Jeff and I go back to Puerto Rico and Guam in the primaries.Thx for sending. I've forwarded to Jake Sullivan in my office to follow up.Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you. .

CdmUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764087 Date: 07/31/2015A letter from Melanne that makes its way into the public domain achieves the same goal of putting out a countering
narrative to whatever handful of outlets have covered this.
But coming from Melanne it is far more confirming of HRC's statement, as opposed to a widely released spokesman
statement which will invariably read like a correction/retraction. I fear how the 3,000 outlets who have not even noticed
this issue will react to this statement.
And with a letter from Melanne, the Sri Lankans still get a response - arguable a more substantive oneJake, I was in this same place an hour ago when we had a conference call with the Secretary. She feels that this has
generated a great deal of media commentary in various quarters, including prominent outlets in this country (LAT) and
in Asia that we have no choice but to respond in a public way. Government supporters are saying that she is listening to
the Tamil diaspora. What this does is reinforces her statement, but gives the government a little something on recent
experience, and then does the pivot to reconciliation and what they need to do now, reinforcing our current policy.
PJHaving read this I wonder if this is better done as a clarifying letter from Melanne to Sri Lankan FM that we publicly
release?
Having the spokesman clarify the Secretary's words in an official statement has a slightly uncomfortable feel to it. It
requires us to set up the critique and then respond to it, rather than just having an official and direct response to the
protest that we can point others to.In the second paragraph, between the second and third sentence, do you want to say explicitly that ""this was the basis
of the Secretary's statement""? Just a thought.Importance: High
Try this. PJ
STATEMENT BY THE SPOKESMAN
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in remarks Wednesday before the United Nations Security Council on the adoption of a
resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict, stated that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a
number of countries. In her statement, she specifically cited Sri Lanka, which prompted an official protest by the
Government of Sri Lanka and some news commentary around the world.
Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult
conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching well into this
decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations substantiated numerous reports of rape
and sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. At the
same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009, though we remained deeply concerned about
reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of detainees, we have not received reports that rape
and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict areas around the world. We hope that
this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.
This controversy should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the
military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the
promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000
displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation that
changes how the Sinhalese and Tamil people relate to each other. The United States stands ready to assist and support
the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.","communitytwelve","samedi","octobre","dmilleneuf","cherylmills","wkend","wkforty","topic27","topic33","topic34",4230,362

KABUL (AP) Millions of Afghans defied threats Thursday to cast ballots in the country's second national elections since
Taliban rule, but turnout appeared weaker this time because of continuing violence, fear and disenchantment. In much
of the Taliban's southern strongholds, many people did not dare to vote, bolstering the hopes of President Hamid
Karzai's chief rival. At least 26 people were killed in election-related violence, fewer than had been feared. Officials
began counting millions of ballots as soon as the polls closed at 5 p.m. after a one-hour extension. First preliminary
results weren't expected for several days, and some major candidates were already alleging fraud. A top election
official, Zekria Barakzai, told The Associated Press that he estimated 40 to 50 percent of the country's 15 million
registered voters cast ballots far lower than the 70 percent who voted in the presidential election in 2004.

A New Approach for Missile Defense
By Hillary Onion
Iran's development of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles poses a clear and growing threat to the security of our
European allies and our own forces stationed in the region. That is why President Obama announced yesterday that the
United States is ready to deploy missile defenses in Europe specifically geared toward stopping these missiles. This is a
threat we cannot ignore.
Previous missile defense efforts have focused on protecting against intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching
the Jnited States, but our intelligence now shows that the threat from these long-range weapons has not progressed as
quickly as had been feared. In contrast, evidence indicates that Iran is developing short- and medium- range missiles
that will eventually enable it to target most of Europe, the Caucuses and the Middle East, including U.S. and NATO
forces.
We deeply appreciate the willingness of the Czech and Polish Governments to host the original missile defense
architecture on their soil, and the decision to deploy other systems to better meet this growing threat came as a result
ofa long and careful review of our policies, capabilities, and requirements. This decision does not alter the unshakeable
commitment of the United States to the security of these vital NATO allies. Rather, it reflects our determination to
jointly meet the threats that endanger us all.
The old focus on long-range missile defense systems left significant gaps in our ability to defend against shorter-range
threats, exposing our allies and our forces stationed in Europe. Many experts have also expressed concerns about the
testing record and effectiveness of the long-range interceptors that were to be deployed in Poland.","communitytwelve","mercredi","septembre","dmilleneuf","cherylmills","nowkend","wkthirtyeight","topic24","topic10","topic7",2010,362

US Responds To Sri Lanka Protest Over Clinton Remark (AFP) Monday, October 5, 2009 AFP
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States, responding to protests from Sri Lanka over remarks by Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, said it had no recent evidence of women being raped while in Sri Lankan government custody.
In a letter addressed to Sri Lanka's Minister of Foreign Affairs Rohitha Bogollagama, the State Department noted that the
US government and international human rights groups over the years had detailed ""numerous cases of rape and sexual
violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government.""
However, the letter signed by Melanne Verveer, ambassador at large for global women's issues at the State Department
said that ""in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009 ... we have not received reports that rape and
sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict area around the world.""
""We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context,"" the letter said, adding that Washington remains
concerned about extrajudicial killings, disappearances and detainee abuse in Sri Lanka.
""Secretary Clinton believes that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the promotion of peace and the
protection of human rights,"" the letter said.
Sri Lanka lodged its protest with the US embassy in Colombo over the remarks made by Clinton last month to the United
Nations Security Council.
""We've seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia, Burma and Sri Lanka and elsewhere,"" the US secretary of state
had said during a resolution calling for an end to sexual violence in armed conflict, according to published reports of
Clinton's remarks.
Her comments sparked an outcry across Sri Lanka, where government forces in May crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after
decades of fighting.
Colombo faced condemnation for its handling of the final stages of the war against Tiger rebels and managed to stave
off a Security Council resolution calling for war crimes investigations thanks to the vetoes of China and Russia.
The United Nations has said that over 7,000 civilians perished in the first four months of intense fighting this year.
Sri Lanka is now facing international pressure to free 250,000 ethnic Tamil civilians who managed to escape the fighting
but are now held in internment camps while they are screened to see whether they were rebels.

FYI. This is my point.
cdmHi Cheryl,
Thanks for your email. I am on a plane now ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â headed back from Istambul. I have not has any time to address this. But I
will certainly work on it shortly. And in fact am meeting with David this week to do so.
But I also think it is essential to take into account the concerns of the Hill. In Jose's hearings and mine, the committee
quite explicitly and directly said they expected us to play significant roles in energy. David should certainly have the lead
role, as the secretary has said and as the legislation clearly spells out, but we also need to figure out how we can work
together. And I am sure that can be done amicably under david's overall leadership in this area. But H should be
consulted and talk to the SFRC before any changes are made to avoid any surprises and be sure they understand what is
being done. And, of course, I want to be sure we bring in Jose on any discussions, since he has important interests in this.
Regards,
BobBob:
I hope you are settling in ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â looking forward to finding a moment to connect with you. I particularly want to make sure
we follow-up on energy in your title and making sure lines are clear in that arena to avoid any dropped balls or missed
opportunities.
I wanted to flag one matter now because the Secretary has asked David Goldwyn during her look-ahead meeting
regarding energy, to move forward on several energy security priorities ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â including engaging with key producers like
Brazil, Mexico, Angola and Nigeria as well as addressing energy security concerns with consumers like China and India.
Given that E/EEB previously had the lead on energy matters before we had an International Energy Coordinator, I want
to make sure you and he are properly and smoothly transitioning matters to him.","communitytwelve","mardi","octobre","dmilleneuf","cherylmills","nowkend","wkforty","topic38","topic3","topic10",2032,362

FYI on several (shocking) updates on that Liberia Amcit case. Scroll all the way to the bottom for all the details.Colleagues,
Charge Robinson, Embassy Monrovia, just called to report that Mr. Fosnight has committed suicide. He was
found in his home at approximately 0500 EDT. The RSO is on the scene and Monrovia's consular section is
aware of the situation and will work to repatriate the body. UNMIL is working to determine who from the UN
will call Fosnight's next-of-kin. Post had no further details, but will continue to provide them to Ops. The
Liberian Minister of Justice has asked UNMIL representatives and Charge Robinson to attend a meeting at
0730 EDT to discuss press responses. The Watch connected the PA/Press duty officer to Embassy Monrovia.One correction: Fosnight's passport was not / not seized. Fosnight says he can't find it (which is interesting,
since he says he planned to fly to Sierra Leone this afternoon).Here is today's update. Sunday has been eventful.
- Fosnight was arrested about 40 minutes ago and is under house arrest. His U.S. passport has been seized. The
Consular Officer is aware and has passed to him (via the RSO, who's on the scene) the names of three local
lawyers. The RSO reported that Fosnight is also seeking to be in touch with a U.S. lawyer. The Consular
Officer will send a report of arrest cable tomorrow, and stands ready to meet with Fosnight.
- The GOL has formally asked UNMIL to assist in making sure that the house arrest is effective, in order to
ensure that Fosnight's rights are protected and to minimize flight risk.","communitytwelve","lundi","aoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»t","dmilleneuf","cherylmills","nowkend","wkthirtyfour","topic23","topic35","topic13",1604,362

I think we are going to need to be very specific about limiting more of her activities in the building than she suggests b/c
as is, she is in many matters here too that are very consuming.
cdmI was delighted to see the Rothkopf piece yesterday, and not only b/c he mentioned me! It identified State as the source
of big ideas under your leadership, ideas that adapt our foreign policy to a 21st c world and allow us to get things done.
As I think about what I want to sink my teeth into over the next 18 months and how I can best serve you, I have
concluded that I want to devote myself full time to the QDDR. -- driving the process and the outcomes as efficiently and
effectvely as possible. I have run something like this before; I know almost all the players; my staff is well plugged into
the building; and I am committed to all the ideas that we want to see emerge. Instead of hiring a senior director, I
propose that the AID designate and I start driving the process by working w/ Karen and the staff and reporting
to/engaging the senior leadiership team on a weekly basis.
As Cheryl and I discussed, I am well aware that taking on this role means cutting many other things that I do. The
demands for policy planning talks have been proliferating because they serve the interests of the bureaus. I am less
convinced that they are the best use of my time or that they allow me to best serve you. There are 2 sets -- one with 5
middle eastern countries that we have agreed to hold in Jordan this fall -- this is their second meeting -- and the second
round of the russia-eu-us talks that I think it would be very detrimental to cancel. But I shd b able to make those each 3
day trips total. Other than that I wd cancel all my planned travel for the fall. I would also limit outside speaking
engagements except to the extent such engagement served QDDR outreach purposes. QDDR meetings will also take
priority on my calendar, alongside meetings w/ my staff on other projects we are pursuing.
As it is shaping up, the QDDR combines thinking and doing in a way that fits what I think I can bring to the table perfectly
and make this what you want it to be. I very much want to take on the role I describe, and hope you agree.

Beihl called me from the plane just before departure. De facto negotiating team will return to DC Wednesday for
several days talks. While ministers were discouraged by de factor regime intransigence, Beihl said that Zelaya had also
lost some support. He said that all the ministers were shocked by Zelaya's behavior in a telephone conference call just
before their press conference this afternoon. Zelaya spoke of people dying by hundreds, being thrown in jail and
tortured. Zelaya appeared to be very out-of-touch, Beihl said. He added that ""even"" the Argentine FM was questioning
whether Z's return was the correct course. Beihl said that while a democratic solution was needed, perhaps Zelaya was
not the right option. I again expressed our position that the problem was not who replaced Zelaya, but that he was
removed unconstitutionally.
News conference was straightforward. Only one minister spoke (I don't know them by face), said that the solution was
return to democratic order and the regime not prepared to accept Si. I haven't got hold of transcript yet, will do so
asap.
Beihl again expressed thanks for our move on visas (as well as our logistical support), saying that all the ministers
thought it a good move.

I spent yesterday with Les Gelb on Nantucket. He had lots to say which might be of interest, but I thought the most
important thing to tell you is to make sure you are aware of the Parade magazine piece he wants to do about you. He
would like to do a day in your life, when you meet with members of Congress and international figures. He wants to
show the impact you are having domestically and internationally. He said he would give you a veto over content and
looked me in the eye and said, ""she will like it"". Maybe you know this, but did not want it to fall between the cracks.

impact of a continuing resolution on State operations and programs.
As you know, if Senator Reid was able/willing to schedule time on the Senate floor there still remains a significant
obstacle. While the FY10 Bill had broad bipartisan support prior to markup, it now includes a controversial Lautenberg
amendment that would reverse the Mexico City policy statutorily. With Lautenberg's amendment in the Bill, procedural
hurdles are almost certain to lengthen and slow down floor action.
It is possible that an agreement could be reached to bring up the Bill and structure votes so that the Republicans could
offer amendments including one to strike Lautenberg's language.
Should you agree to ask the Secretary to make such a call I would imagine she would want to get views from Jack Lew,
Pat Kennedy, Rich Greene, and Rich Verma, first.

United Nations agency for culture and education. The chairman of UNESCO's executive board says Bulgaria's
ambassador to France, Irina Bokova, has beaten longtime Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosny in secret
balloting. UNESCO's press office says Bokova won 31 to 27 Tuesday in a suspenseful fifth round. The Egyptian was long
considered a favorite, despite his threat last year to burn Israeli books, and Egypt's contentious record of cultural
censorship under his watch. Hosny apologized for the book-burning comment, but many Jewish activists said he was
unfit to be the U.N.'s guardian of culture.","communityeleven","mardi","septembre","dmilleneuf","humaabedin","nowkend","wkthirtyeight","topic22","topic7","topic20",718,373

It is with great pride and a full heart that I write to thank you for your personal, videotaped message congratulating Gays
and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies (GLIFAA) on winning this year's ""Outie"" award for best LGBT employee resource
group by Out & Equal Workplace Advocates . Your message and the significance carried in delivering it personally was
reflected in the silence that came over the audience of over 2,000 people when you began speaking and the furious
applause heard afterwards. While not the only GLIFAA member in attendance that night to receive the award, as the
only Foreign Service Officer there to witness the event, the award held special significance for me. Your message had
the greatest impact on everyone attending the Out & Equal Summit this year, but as a direct beneficiary of your work I
was especially touched and awed.
It is you, Under Secretary Kennedy, and all the senior staff of the Department that truly deserve this honor. As an FSO
with a domestic partner, your efforts to bring equality to State have allowed me to stay in a career I love. Thank you for
all you are doing for the LGBT community, for the Foreign and Civil Service, and for the opportunity to attend such a
conference. I am once again proud to represent the Foreign Service, the Department of State, and the Bureau of
Intelligence and Research.

it is the only meal I get everyday"". Vilsack was glad for what we were doing, but the event made him realize how much
more there is to do.
BillThanks - keep the updates coming!Keynote lunch speaker was Indra Nooyi, the chair and ceo of Pepsi Co. She noted that this event is growing in both size
and importance every year. Attendence at the lunch alone was over 950 people including Secretary Vilsack and
ministers from many countries. She specifically complemented Secretary Clinton's role in the Sept 26 UN event. Nooyi
used much of her address challenging the private sector to do their part in carrying out the strategy unveiled in New
York.
Secretary Vilsack gave a very powerful address that focused on our efforts feed hungry children and the need to do
more. He refered to working with Secretary Clinton or to ""under Secretary Clinton's leadership"" at least 3 times. It was
very well done.

Rich and I met this morning with Chris Socha, Senator DeMint's foreign policy staffer. We took the
opportunity to discuss the nominations of Tom Shannon and Arturo Valenzuela. As you know, DeMint has
been very outspoken regarding Zelaya's ouster in Honduras.
With respect to Tom, it appears as though little has changed - DeMint still appears to be insisting on some
amount of floor debate followed by a roll call vote on the nomination. How much time and when is still
something that needs to be worked out. We've been following up on our end, but the DeMint camp has
slow walked things a bit. We expect to come to some agreement when the Senate reconvenes.
Arturo's nomination is in a different posture. As we approached the Senate's August recess, there
appeared to be some loosening of DeMint's hold on him. After speaking with DeMint's staff, we're still
hopeful that we could get Arturo confirmed by either voice vote or by unanimous consent when the Senate
returns. However, Chris warned that DeMint is monitoring closely the Administration's position
with regards to sanctions. He warned that if a coup determination is made and new sanctions
levied, this could very well have an adverse impact on how Arturo's nomination moves forward.
We wanted to alert you to this latter point because we understand a determination from L
could be coming down shortly.
DeMint's staffer explained that the Senator would welcome a call from either S or Deputy Steinberg, and
he thought a call could go a long way to freeing up Arturo's nomination. We're preparing a call sheet for
Deputy Steinberg.
Thanks.

By Devin Talbott and Strobe Talbott
Saturday, August 29, 2009
Many opponents of health-care reform have concentrated their fire on a provision in House
legislation that would provide for government reimbursement to doctors who offer end-of-life
counseling. How our society deals with those confronting death is understandably controversial.
Unfortunately, the debate has degenerated into a cacophony of demagoguery and distortion,
including invocations of Hitler and fear-mongering about ""death panels."" As a result of these
attacks, a number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from Congress
have abandoned support for end-of-life counseling.
Our family's experience this year provided a vivid perspective on the value of that service and
the misguidedness of the campaign against it. Brooke Shearer -- wife, mother and grandmother
-- had been fighting cancer for more than a year. She had undergone major surgery, numerous
scans and biopsies, and two debilitating courses of chemotherapy. Her doctors were among the
best in their fields. Their expertise did not, however, extend to the fine points of, and latest
advances in, pain management.
Brooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of her
family for whatever time we had together. With that goal in mind, she sought advice and
treatment from palliative-care specialists at Washington Home and Community Hospices. Their
ingenuity and skill in adjusting her medications significantly alleviated her discomfort in her
final months. Working closely with her primary physicians, the hospice staff helped Brooke
anticipate the likely course of her disease in a way that allowed her to make decisions and
exercise a degree of control over both her own condition and our family's adjustment to it.
When her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working, Brooke put herself fully
into the hands of Washington Home as an outpatient. Regular house calls by hospice doctors,
nurses and social workers enabled her to stay active on professional projects, spend time with
friends and family, and end her life at home, which was a considerable comfort to her and to us.
These, not issues of cost, were the principal considerations for our family. However, controlling
the cost of health care -- especially in the last year of life -- is an important part of the current
national debate. Therefore it is worth noting that Brooke's treatment in the last stages of her
illness was far less expensive than it had been in the previous year.","communityeleven","lundi","aoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»t","dmilleneuf","strobetalbott","nowkend","wkthirtyfive","topic21","topic24","topic14",2592,6

Haqqani asked me to submit a proposal to help the Government of Pakistan strengthen its communications with the
Pakistani public.
You may recall that my firm did similar hands-on work in Lebanon. The idea is to enhance the Government's internal
capacity to raise public awareness of its accomplishments, build support for its policies, and demonstrate the benefits of
democratic governance.
With stronger communications, they'd obviously be in a better position to convey the benefits of the US-Pakistan
relationship. We've followed Pakistani media coverage of Kerry-Lugar -- with more strategic communications
management by the Government, that could have been a positive story.

cdmTerrorizing Aid to Somalia
The United States is willfully letting millions of Somalis go hungry in
its drive to hunt down terrorists.
BY NATALIE PARKE I OCTOBER 30, 2009
There is a new humanitarian crisis unfolding in Somalia, and the United States is partly to blame. Despite
sending $2 million and 40 tons of arms and ammunition to the country's Transitional Federal Government
(TFG) earlier this year, now, the United States is withholding humanitarian aid until relief agencies agree to
comply with strict, game-stopping conditions.
The decision to abruptly halt assistance came following suspicions that U.S. aid might be ending up with
Somali ""terrorists."" The main worry is an al Qaeda-linked group called al-Shabab, the leading Islamic militant
group fighting against the feeble but internationally backed government. Al-Shabab controls most of south-
central Somalia, while the TFG controls only a few areas of the capital, Mogadishu. The south-central region is
home to 2.7 million of the 3.63 million Somalis in need of emergency assistance. So, reaching many of
Somalia's people with aid would likely entail operating on al-Shabab's turf and interacting with elements of the
group to facilitate logistics.
U.S. Treasury Department sanctions strictly prohibit any financial transactions or dealings with al-Shabab and
other Somali groups labeled as ""terrorists."" Yet clearly the concern is not absolute; the U.S. government seems
less concerned that the guns and ammo sent as military assistance, intended to prop up the fragile government
and keep control of a country brimming with violence, are allegedly being resold on the streets of Mogadishu.
The halt in humanitarian assistance will cripple the work of relief organizations and, as a consequence, hurt
their Somali beneficiaries. U.S. officials justifiably fear that they and their partners could be held responsible,
even prosecuted, for supporting terrorists if relief funds ended up in the hands of al-Shabab. At first, the U.S.
government reviewed the situation and ""delayed"" funding. Subsequently, Washington issued conditions with
which aid agencies must comply to legally operate in Somalia. But the conditions are so restrictive that it would","communitytwelve","mardi","novembre","dmilleneuf","cherylmills","nowkend","wkfortyfour","topic14","topic6","topic35",2338,362

Iran charges three detained Americans with espionage
(Adds background)
TEHRAN, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Iran has charged three detained U.S. citizens with espionage, the official IRNA news agency
quoted a judiciary official as saying on Monday. ""The three are charged with espionage. Investigations continue into the
three detained Americans in Iran,"" Tehran general prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said. The three were held after
they strayed into Iran from northern Iraq at the end of July. The three, Shane Bauer, 27, Sarah Shourd, 31, and Josh
Fattal, 27, crossed into Iranian territory nearly two months ago. Their families say they strayed across the border
accidentally. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad suggested in an interview with the American television network
NBC in September that the Americans' release might be linked to the release of Iranian diplomats he said were being
held by U.S. troops in Iraq. Under Iran's Islamic sharia law, espionage is punishable by death.

Friday evening Hugo and I began picking up from de facto sources that M was about to enter a meeting with supporters
and that some of the hardliners were making yet another attempt to dissuade M from taking a leave of absence. We
immediately phoned contacts close to M and warned that if M reneged, we would launch a massive round of visa
revocations, to include families. A couple hours later, sources began to report that M had decided definitively to step
aside as announced. Former President Maduro played a key role in persuading M to keep his promise.
Later, Panamanian VP/FM Varela called me to say he had heard from his private sector contacts in Honduras that M had
""ratified"" the decision to take a leave of absence.
We will stay on top of this until M actually leaves.

U.S. aid worker held over Afghan boy's shooting
KABUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - An American aid worker in northern Afghanistan is being held by Afghan authorities over the
fatal shooting of an Afghan teenager at his home, a provincial police chief said on Wednesday.
Mohammad Bilal Niram, chief of police in the northern Sar-i-pul province, said the aid worker had killed his landlord's
16-year-old son with three gunshots, possibly suspecting a burglary when the boy tried to enter his home.
""He is in Afghan government custody for investigation. He has not been charged,"" Niram said.
The man worked for GP he said, referring to Global Partners, a UK-based aid group which says it has run programmes in
Afghanistan since 1993. Staff at the organisation's London headquarters declined to comment on the incident.
John Groch, a spokesman for the U.S. embassy, confirmed that an American had been arrested in Sar-i-pul but said he
could give no further details pending the Afghan police investigation.

The White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. But
State's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell,
surely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert, Jeff Bader, another pro like
Campbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball. Perhaps Mr. Obama might take responsibility
himself, as President Kennedy did after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Now, that would truly clear the airÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âand open the
door to some obvious and necessary changes in the administration's decision-making machinery. Every decision, large
and small, is shaped and made by the president himself and enforced by Denis McDonough, a deputy NSC adviser and
the administration's Lord High Executioner. Does Obama get enough pushback? Is he hearing a range of views? Can he
see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia
journey and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside
counselors or outside advisers.

Obama Administration. I am especially grateful to the Secretary for the confidence she has shown in me, and her
willingness to make me part of her team. I consider this an enormous honor and I hope that I have met her
expectations. I look forward to continuing to be part of her team from Brazil.
I am preparing a ""Last Thoughts"" paper for the Secretary, which will look back over the past ten months, identify
accomplishments, and point toward what I think needs to come next. I will share this paper with Arturo.
Regarding Honduras, Craig did heroic work there this week, and we are moving toward a potentially big step by
Micheletti that would open space for many of our allies to support the elections. As we move forward, it is important to
note that the solution to the crisis is becoming more and more Honduran with each step in the process. This is a good
thing, because it increases the chances that the resolution will be peaceful, enduring, and a platform for the political
reforms that must come next.
It is worth highlighting that the Secretary, through her outreach to both sides and her clear commitment to the future of
Honduran democracy, has positioned us as an honest broker in this dispute. The only honest broker. Everyone one else
in this drama -- from Insulza to the Brazilians to the Albinos -- has other agendas and motives in play. In this regard, we
are the only hope of the Honduran people. The internal dialogue taking place, within the de facto regime, among its
supporters, and between the Micheletti and Zelaya camps, is the product of our engagement. No one else could have
done this. I urge that you keep this in mind as we move forward and as we consider how we will support the November
29 elections.
Finally, I leave behind a great Bureau. I believe it is the best in the State Department. Craig and the other DASes are
superb, and I believe we have an extraordinary cadre of Ambassadors. This is a huge resource for the Secretary and the
President. Use it.

The next six months will be a critical time for establishing the Department's leadership in
bridging relationships for U.S. intergovernmental officials and their foreign counterparts,
defining the mission and role of the Office of the Special Representative for Global
Intergovernmental Affairs (""S/SRGIA""), and outlining an agenda that serves the needs of the
Department and these officials. Our approach will be strategic and integrated, working in
collaboration with Department bureaus and USAID offices to strengthen and deliver on the
Secretary's and Administration's priorities.
II. Key Objectives
The Special Representative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs will serve the global
needs of the U.S. intergovernmental officials and the entities they represent. The S/SRGIA will
also connect U.S. state and local officials with intergovernmental officials around the world,
promote local capacity building investments and programs to enhance country-led processes, and
facilitate the needs and goals of intergovernmental officials here and abroad consistent with
Department priorities.
III. Next Steps
This work plan describes activities that the S/SRGIA plans to initiate, grow and
implement in the next six months. To place the Work Plan in context, we describe below
S/SRGIA' s work-planning process.
A. Establish S/SRGIA Mission and Role in the Department.
Currently, no one and no office in the State Department has accountability to serve the
needs of intergovernmental officials, (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected leaders, the entities
that represent them) with respect to their global affairs portfolios. State and local officials'
concerns are typically routed on an individual basis through bureaus with the results reflecting ,
the priority of the person in the bureau's estimation or the nature of the request. Priority","communityNA","jeudi","dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cembre","dmilleneuf","retajolewis","nowkend","wkfiftythree","topic34","topic16","topic37",1860,1

At a high level, I think leaders' conversations on Thursday will begin to narrow gaps on the big issues -- transparency,
funding, inscribing commitments, etc -- IF (and it's a big if) those gaps are narrow-able. If they're not, then
Thursday/Friday will be days of trying and failing ... but at least trying.
Todd's view is that there is not enough time Friday for top-level meetings to close the deal; that two days are required.

This Week in Copenhagen
December 12, 2009
Editorial
We didn't expect much from the first week of the global warming conference in Copenhagen. Countries need to do a
little posturing before getting down to the hard work, which is supposed to start on Monday. But the belligerent talk
from China seemed to go well beyond the usual positioning.
The best hope is that the talks will produce an interim understanding under which industrialized countries would
commit to fairly precise targets for reduced emissions, and others, like China, to broader but measurable goals. The
industrial countries would be expected to help poorer countries shift to less-polluting forms of energy.
That would set the stage for a legally binding deal in 2010. But there is no chance of even an interim agreement without
the enthusiastic participation of China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. China's absence would give other
developing countries ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and the United States Senate ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â an excuse to do less than needed.","communityone","samedi","dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cembre","dmilleneuf","jakesullivan","wkend","wkfifty","topic3","topic38","topic11",2318,247

Today, my cabinet authorized a policy of restraint regarding settlements which will include a suspension of new permits
and new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months.
My cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace.
We hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that will
finally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel.
We are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region.
We have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace, the Palestinians and the Arab
world would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill.
Well, the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today.
I hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning and
a new future for our children and for their children.
Since the day our government was sworn in eight months ago, we have been calling for direct negotiations with the
Palestinians.
During that time, we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climate
in which political negotiations would have the best chance to succeed.Make sure Daniel R gets transcripts of what Mitchell and I said to the PA so Abbas can see it and if there is a transcript of

Attached and below is the proposed final Retreat Agenda.
The chief challenge I see is in having each bureau give 3 minutes on their top 3 priorities.
I think it is worthwhile from the standpoint that this is the first time all will be together with the chance to see/meet and
hear from everyone, but it will take time to hear from everyone. I've broken it up into 2 sections of an hour
each. Without these sections, the Retreat would breathe ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â with them it's tight though I have left padding in each
section.
I also am holding a place for up front for Susan Rice to present if she comes ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â she has not rsvped.
Please see below and attached and advise if there are other suggested changes.
Bill Burns cannot attend the retreat and currently will give his update on Iran to Jim; we also will have Jim address Iraq in
his overview too.

It was a substantive meeting. I don't think we could have been clearer about our position. As expected, burmese
weren't in a position to make any commitments, but said they'd take it back to the senior leadership. They focused on
the ethnic insurgencies as a source of instability.
Tone was good, and I think Kurt did a very good job laying out our points -- clear, firm, diplomatic.

October 23, 2009Re: Tony Blair, EU presidency, Tory Party, & Berlin trip
One of your agenda items behind the scenes on your Berlin trip can be to discuss the future of the EU, the
European presidency and the prospects of Tony Blair. If Blair does not become EU president the position will
likely be filled by a third rank nonentity in the Brussels bureaucratic mode incapable of realizing the
possibilities in the creation of the office, continuing the feebleness of Europe as a political idea and reality. Of
course, it is in the US interest to have a strong EuropeÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âand the naming of the first European president might be
the most important opportunity for the US to strengthen Europe, to give it actual sinew, for a long time and a
long time to come.
The Conservative Party is split over Europe and Blair. Hague represents the Tory right, which is the center of
the party. He is supported prominently by Boris Johnson, mayor of London, also known as the Tory ""clown
prince."" The responsible wing, such as Chris Patten, the former European Commissioner, and Douglas Hurd,
former Foreign Secretary, are pro-European and not necessarily hostile to having Blair there as a counter-weight
to the anti-Europeans of their own government, helping to tilt things more their way. All present themselves as
""pro-American,"" sine qua non of Conservative rhetoric, though there is a nasty anti-American undercurrent on
the Tory right. Hague tried to paper this over in his conference with you and was disingenuous about the nature
of the far right parties the Tories are aligned with in Europe. Nobody in the UK or Europe is fooled.
Cameron is trying to balance the wings of the Conservative Party. On domestic policy, he is more radical than
his Etonian image suggests (profound connotations of the Conservative paternalistic, aristocratic one-nation
tradition), more influenced by the Thatcher legacy, more like George W. Bush influenced by Reagan and
Reaganism than by his father and vestigial moderate Republicanism. On foreign policy, Cameron is unsure,
inexperienced, oblique, and largely uncommitted. So far his foreign policy is little more than projection of his
domestic politics, especially his need to keep his party behind him going into the election. His political","communitytwelve","vendredi","octobre","dmilleneuf","sidneyblumenthal","nowkend","wkfortythree","topic30","topic25","topic4",2407,94

Lautenberg would like the letter below sent to his office today. Upon receipt of the letter, we are

Dear Senator Lautenberg,
I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you this past weekend regarding the custody case of
Sean Goldman, the young American boy wrongfully detained in Brazil for more than five
years. As we discussed, the Administration has long maintained that Sean should be reunited with
his father David in New Jersey. I have made a point of emphasizing this position with Brazilian
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim during our many conversations, as have other U.S. Officials with
their Brazilian counterparts.
We have worked closely with the Government of Brazil to ensure it upholds its obligations under
the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. We were quite concerned by last week's
decision suspending the order reuniting Sean with his father. We were encouraged, however, by
the appeal filed last Friday by the Brazilian Solicitor General which challenges this
suspension. Like you, we are eager to learn of the outcome of this appeal. We understand a
decision could be announced shortly.
You can be assured that we will continue advocating for the reunification of Sean and his
father and pressing the Government of Brazil to ensure swift consideration of the Goldman case so
that this long legal process may reach a final conclusion without further delay. In the meantime,
please be assured that the State Department as well as the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia has been and
will continue to be a resource to the Goldman family during this trying time.

Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene
Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion
continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her
relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)
Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks
are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push
on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to
wind up today and resume on Monday.
Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.
The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within
the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too
much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also
moved.
The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal
Dodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework
requires consultation, legislation, and implementation.
The role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues, such as Irish
language act, N-S bodies, etc, while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with.","communityone","samedi","janvier","dmilledix","jakesullivan","wkend","wkfive","topic19","topic4","topic11",1853,247

Senior Watch OfficerImportance: HighGiven the hour here, I am less optimistic that we will pull off a return tonight, but we are still working to that end.
The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢
has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing the
decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until the
proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with David
Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some understanding from
Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.PLEASE NOTE ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â I am aware of the intense interest back in DC about this case and will be passing information just as soon
as I receive it. This means that in most cases, I will not be able to confirm the information. Will try to identify credible
sources vice what rumor/press/others are saying.
Brazilian Central Authority (BCA) coordinating with David's attorney and the Federal attorneys in Rio to ensure that the
President of the Regional Federal Court in Rio has a copy of the STF order and is submitting the official request to federal
police to enforce. BCA says they still believe they can effect the turnover tonight and are at their office working to that
end. If/when the Federal Police enforce, their stated preference is to go to the airport and effect the handover there.
This is a scenario we've planned for.
BCA has mentioned the STJ motions filed by the Brazilian family as a potential obstacle, but thru their contacts in
Mendes' office at STF, have heard that Mendes intends to reach out to the reporting judge at STJ to resolve that issue.
As mentioned in an earlier update today, we have not had any confirmation that the STJ judge has accepted to hear the
motions filed by the Brazilian family, and has the option to decline to hear them.If the family sees the writing on the wall (frankly unlikely at this point) and agrees to abide by the order of immediate
return, then in theory the handover would happen at the consulate and there is a plan in place for that.
Plans in motion to prevent them slipping away and Patricia Lamego is working with the police as we speak. Federal
Police repeatedly assured us they were prepped and ready to move but could take no action absent an order. They
know now there is one, so BCA will get them moving.
If the handover occurred tonight, I'm told we need 3 hours to get the plane off the ground, so overnight in the hotel.Marie, if there is a handover tonight: that would be at the Consulate in Rio, right? Grandparents would bring Sean and
he'd spend the night...in David's hotel or at the Consulate?
It seems very, very unlikely that will happen tonight.
But if handover is delayed until morning, the family may try to slip away tonight. Can we ask the police to prevent that?Importance: High","communityeleven","mercredi","dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cembre","dmilleneuf","humaabedin","nowkend","wkfiftytwo","topic23","topic38","topic2",4059,373

I want you to know that last month a friend of mine convinced me to apply for a fellowship at Harvard/Institute of
Politics, and I did. A few days ago, I got a call from the Program Director who informed me that I was accepted. I am very
excited about it and think it will be a very good opportunity to share my experience with students who
are learning theories about democracy and development.
Cheryl, I am going to be bold and ask you if you would accept my invitation to come and speak to the students while I
am there. I am asked and encouraged to invite important personalities who can talk of their experience in government
and I thought of you. I would be thrilled if you accept. I will be there from end of January until the beginning of May next
year. I have also invited President Moreno of IDB who accepted and I am waiting for an answer from Michaelle Jean, the
General Governor of Canada.
I wish you the very best, to you and your family for Christmas and the New Year. I hope our roads cross again as we
thrive to better the lives of so many people who deserve it. Please extend my wished to the Secretary of State. I admire
her and her work.

beamed to the world via social media and other online tools despite the government's media blackout.
This week, a loose, multi-national network of protesters, bloggers, Web developers and everyday Internet users has ramped up
again in the wake of renewed anti-government street demonstrations that turned deadly Sunday on Ashura, a Shiite Muslim holy
day commemorating the death of 7th Century cleric Imam Hussein.
This time, Internet analysists and online activists involved in the movement have told CNN that a government initially caught flat-
footed at how easily information flowed out of the country was ready to fight back.
""It's clear the government has been definitely restricting the Internet in a much more controlled way,"" said Cyrus Farivar, an
Iranian-American freelance journalist who writes about technology issues. ""They're definitely paying attention and, at the very
least, trying to intimidate people.""
And retaliation has been brutal ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â both for those taking to the streets and those spreading the word online.
One of the most compelling videos to emerge from the recent unrest showed what the people who posted it said was an Iranian
government vehicle plowing into a crowd of protesters, apparently running over and, they say, killing a woman.
Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, Tehran's chief prosecutor, said Tuesday that seven people were killed in the Ashura riots. The
demonstrations were the deadliest since June. Those left at least eight dead, according to Iran's Supreme National Security
Council ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â although dissidents and observers have said there were many more.
The world was able to learn about those protests through first-person accounts online after a disputed election that returned
hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to office despite serious questions about polling results.
As protests swelled, Iran's government began kicking out some reporters from some traditional Western media outlets, arresting
others and restricting the movements of those who remained.
In their place sprung citizen journalists who posted videos, photos and firsthand accounts on Twitter feeds, Facebook groups
and sites like Flickr and YouTube. They kept images of the protests -- and the sometimes bloody response of government
backers ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â in front of the world.
As early as election day, both opposition political leaders and anti-government protesters said cell-phone signals were being
jammed. They consistently reported networking Web sites in Iran being blocked, phone lines disconnected and protest sites
allegedly infiltrated by government spies who spread misinformation and sought the identities of those speaking against the
regime.
That experience, observers say, had the government primed for the most recent explosion of information.
""The spike at the beginning, right after the election, was pretty chaotic,""said Austin Heap, a San Francisco-based Web
developer who has helped Iranian dissidents report from within their country. ""Not even their government knew what they were
going to do and how they were going to handle things.http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/12/30/iran.social.media/

And retaliation has been brutal ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â both for those taking to the streets and those spreading the word online.
One of the most compelling videos to emerge from the recent unrest showed what the people who posted it said was an Iranian
government vehicle plowing into a crowd of protesters, apparently running over and, they say, killing a woman.
Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, Tehran's chief prosecutor, said Tuesday that seven people were killed in the Ashura riots. The
demonstrations were the deadliest since June. Those left at least eight dead, according to Iran's Supreme National Security
Council ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â although dissidents and observers have said there were many more.
The world was able to learn about those protests through first-person accounts online after a disputed election that returned
hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to office despite serious questions about polling results.
As protests swelled, Iran's government began kicking out some reporters from some traditional Western media outlets, arresting
others and restricting the movements of those who remained.
In their place sprung citizen journalists who posted videos, photos and firsthand accounts on Twitter feeds, Facebook groups
and sites like Flickr and YouTube. They kept images of the protests -- and the sometimes bloody response of government
backers ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â in front of the world.
As early as election day, both opposition political leaders and anti-government protesters said cell-phone signals were being
jammed. They consistently reported networking Web sites in Iran being blocked, phone lines disconnected and protest sites
allegedly infiltrated by government spies who spread misinformation and sought the identities of those speaking against the
regime.
That experience, observers say, had the government primed for the most recent explosion of information.
""The spike at the beginning, right after the election, was pretty chaotic,""said Austin Heap, a San Francisco-based Web
developer who has helped Iranian dissidents report from within their country. ""Not even their government knew what they were
going to do and how they were going to handle things.","communitytwelve","mercredi","dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cembre","dmilleneuf","cherylmills","nowkend","wkfiftythree","topic38","topic24","topic8",7296,362

Cheryl,
I'm sure we'll never know all that you and Secretary Clinton (and probably President Clinton too) did behind the scenes to secure the
release of Jim Allen and seven other Americans who were detained in Haiti for 20 days, but we wanted to thank you nevertheless. We
appreciated the promptness with which you assigned a first rate liaison to communicate with us - Ted Coley - and we appreciate the
accomodations State made in the form of information delivery to Jim and assistance with his return to the United States. Jim is resting
in Fort Lauderdale now and will return to Amarillo by private plane later in the morning. His wife Lisa is with him in Fort
Lauderdale. The country is fortunate to have first rate diplomats and crisis responders like you in positions of public responsibility,
and we appreciated your willingness to look carefully at the facts, including the distinctions between the roles played by each of the
Americans who went to Haiti as volunteers.
Again, thank you on our behalf, and on behalf of the Allen family, and best wishes with continuing relief and recovery efforts.

The political timing on the EU presidency is accelerating. Sarkozy and Merkel are meeting tonight (October 18)
to discuss it. The Czech constitutional court will issue its verdict on the legality of the Lisbon treaty on
November 3. Shortly after, perhaps that week, before you meet with Merkel on November 8-9, there may be an
EU Council meeting to decide the matter. So you may want to weigh in before then.
Tony is somewhat downcast on his chances. (He met with Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post yesterday; his
mood was described to me.) The Tories have ramped up their campaign against himÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Ânot only do they not want
him but they also do not want an effective EU president. Cameron has come down on the side of the anti-EU
wing of his party on this, an easy move. In an intriguing complication, there's talk now of David Miliband
becoming EU foreign secretary if Tony does not become EU president. Miliband denied he was interested and
endorsed Tony. This is part of the anti-Blair campaign ginned up by the Tories, extended to hurt Miliband if
they can. Jonathan Powell is less gloomy than Tony, thinks everything is still in play, which is why your part in
this may yet be important.","communitytwelve","mercredi","octobre","dmilleneuf","sidneyblumenthal","nowkend","wkfortyfour","topic30","topic3","topic19",1370,94

British and Irish PMs endorse power-sharing deal Link to this video
Northern Ireland's leaders have been rewarded with the promise of a new US investment programme after securing a
historic deal today which saved power sharing.
Gordon Brown and his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, flew into Northern Ireland to put their seal of approval on the deal,
which will create a Department of Justice, gives unionists concessions on the issue of Protestant parades and saves the
power-sharing executive from collapse.
Brown said the achievements over the longest period of unbroken negotiations since the peace process began 16 years
ago were inspirational.
""This is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years
of talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Tonight the White House said Barack Obama saw the deal as ""an important step to greater peace and prosperity for all
communities on the island.""
Obama would also meet Cowen, the DUP leader and first minister Peter Robinson and the deputy first minister, Sinn
Fein's Martin McGuinness, in Washington on St Patrick's Day next month.
Earlier, Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, said the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein was a ""shining
example to other parts of the world locked in religious and ethnic conflicts"".","communitytwelve","samedi","fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©vrier","dmilledix","sidneyblumenthal","wkend","wksix","topic4","topic38","topic19",1884,94

been pushing the Palauns to press for more. Kurt reached out to him per your instruction and we will get you a
complete memo.As I have said repeatedly, I do not want to see Palau shortchanged. I do not know whether this assessment is accurate,
so can I pls get an update and recommendation about to take care of this?Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the US against a resolution calling
for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two other states in free association with the US.
did not support the US position. Important officials in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in U.S.
assistance that Alcy Frelick has insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small
amount of assistance that Palau is receiving is ironic in light of the substantial increase in assistance pledged to the two
other freely associated states just a few years ago. It is also misinformed and misguided.

One other thought.
If the idea of building network of small new schools is just nuts given the infrastructure challenges, an alternative is
more of the 'street school' approach. We take storefronts, little mom and pop storefronts, etc... and do minor
reconfiguration and you have a whole set of little street schools clustered around central location. This could work, posesHey Cheryl,
Here are some quick thoughts on re-building school infrastructure in Port-au-Prince. Feel free to share with whomever
you'd like.
I have little idea of the larger context here ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â how many schools/kids are we looking at, but one thing we've learned in the
US in the last 5 years is that good teachers are the #1 lever of change in education. If we got 1,000 really great teachers
into Port-au-Prince (w/ even a modicum of support and materials), they'd make a big difference and touch the lives of
30,000-60,000 kids.
I think this is totally doable, in short-order, in a magnificent way that could set the foundation for a well-educated
generation of Haitians who could lead the country out of poverty, to self-sustainability, self-governance and openness.

January 11,2010Re: Northern Ireland crisis and latest UK coup
The political crisis in Northern Ireland is fast moving and fluid. On Friday, January 7, after reading a lengthy
statement on TV denouncing his wife repeatedly for her affair (with a teenager), Peter Robinson assured Shaun
Woodward privately that no financial irregularity was involved. Then, within hours, it was reported that Iris
Robinson secured 50,000 pounds from government contractors to give to her lover to set up a restaurant. Peter
Robinson in fact knew of the money all along. Robinson had an opportunity to save himself, perhaps, by
declaring himself for engagement on devolution, freeing himself of the DUP hardliners and throwing himself on
public opinion, but was incapable of acting. By accepting his withdrawal as First Minister for six weeks today,
the DUP has maintained a modicum of Robinson's authority, though it is in suspended animation. His
temporary replacement, Arlene Foster, according to Shaun, comes from the modernizing wing of the party.
Shaun does not know if her naming indicates a potetinally positive direction or makes her a prisoner of those
who put her in place. The silence of Sinn Fein is telling. Not reacting in horror, Sinn Fein is unsure whether this
is good or bad news, and it's willing to wait. But the waiting game is untenable without forward movement on
devolution.","communitytwelve","lundi","janvier","dmilledix","sidneyblumenthal","nowkend","wktwo","topic4","topic19","topic25",1436,94

Benjamin Netanyahu was referring to the Jordan River Valley along the eastern border of the West Bank. Palestinians
claim all of the West Bank as part of their future state.
Netanyahu's pronouncement comes as the U.S. is pushing hard to restart peace talks. Palestinians hesitate to
negotiate because of Netanyahu's hardline attitudes and Israeli settlement construction.
Netanyahu told a parliamentary committee Tuesday that the Jordan Valley's strategic importance makes it impossible
for Israel to withdraw, according to a meeting participant who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting
was closed.","communityeleven","mardi","mars","dmilledix","humaabedin","nowkend","wknine","topic8","topic35","topic5",814,373

Raj,
In organizing efforts for Haiti you may want to reach out to Michele Pierre Louis, the former Prime Minister, who is on
the ground. I have attaached below a short email describing the situation. She is a superb executive and has one of the
best insights into what is needed.
StewartStewart,
We are safe but Port-au-Prince is destroyed. My appartment is gone.
FOKAL is safe fortunately but a few employees had their homes destroyed, like mine. The phones don't work so it is
easier to stay in touch by internet.
The situation is dramatic. the governement is powerless. The Palace, the Parliament, the Ministries, the Minustah are
non operational. We cannot count the dead. is dead and Minustah's headquarters collapsed. We ran out of
medical supplies, water, food for the first reliefs, and then we have to think about reconstruction.
As soon as we can talk I'll call you to talk about specifics.
The hard part is that there have been over 40 repeats after the first tough seism and we don't know if it is over yet.
We keep in touch.
MicheleMichele,
I heard you, Loraine and the family are ok.. Please call me if you have a chance or ask Loraine to. I talked with
nd want to discuss how we can be helpful.

We arrived at the general hospital last night with 1500 people sick or dying with 40 percent needing surgery. It has no
water electricity or food and very limited surgical suites or supplies It the largest and most well known public hospital in
the city and according to PIH and paul farmer needs to be supported and it's infrastucture needs to be rebuilt.
Right now we have surgeons but not enough operating rooms set up. We
desperately need to get a generator and fuel and surgical lights and surgery supplies not just first aid. There are
hundreds including children with festering wounds needing amputation and emergency
surgical care. The doctors nurses and patients have no food or water.
Can you help get the infrastructure of electricity water and a medical hospital tent for post op patients. We are
operating with headlamps and hacksaws rinsed with alcohol.
If we have the electricity and water we can open 11 operating rooms tomorrow if we get what we need. Can the
military help ASAP and for security of equipment and medication.
Until this morning when
none at the General.
did the first amuptation there was almost no surgery happening at all here in the city and
Five days after the quake with no acute surgical care wounds are
festering patients are getting septic and dying. If we had a little
help with basic servcices we could stop this.
I don't have cell or email at the hospital. Please coordinate with Claire Pierre or Nancy from PIH.
Thank you thank you thank you.

refers to the GOH by saying that there is severe corruption in all branches of government, called this
morning asking for a copy of the report (which we sent him), saying that the President was upset and wanted to read it.
The Embassy human rights officer sent the Department a first draft of this report late last year. It normally would have
gone through two or three more versions with input from DRL and ultimately clearance by the Embassy Front Office.
Because our Human Rights officer (Kathey-Lee Galvin) was seriously injured in the quake, DRL took it upon themselves to
finish the report. The final draft was never sent to us for clearance/comments and I don't know who all in the
Department cleared off on it. You may already be familiar with the report, but in the event you are not. I wanted you to

The Doomsday Weapon
IT IS already a commonplace to say that people who don't learn from history are condemned to repeat their mistakes.
Some 1942 years ago, the Jews in the province called Palaestina launched a revolt against the Roman Empire. In
retrospect, this looks like an act of madness. Palestine was a small and insignificant part of the world-wide empire which
had just won a crushing victory against the rival power ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â the Parthian Empire (Persia) ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and put down a major rebellion
in Britain. What chances could the Jewish revolt have?
God knows what was going on in the mind of the ""Zealots"". They eliminated the moderate leaders, who warned against
provoking the empire, and gained sway over the Jewish population of the country. They relied on God. Perhaps they also
relied on the Jews in Rome and believed that their influence over the Senate would restrain the Emperor, Nero. Perhaps
they had heard that Nero was weak and about to fall.","communitytwelve","dimanche","mars","dmilledix","sidneyblumenthal","wkend","wktwelve","topic30","topic38","topic9",1496,94

Dear Cheryl --
Attached please find a letter regarding the review of terrorist lists currently taking place within the Obama
Administration. The letter cites Cuba as a nation that should be purged from such lists, including the State
Sponsors of Terrorism list, as an example for the need of a thorough, robust and judicious review and updating
of these lists.
Can you please ensure that the Secretary and other relevant State Department officials are made aware of this
letter?

Haiti recovery blueprint includes foreign donors
BY JACQUELINE CHARLES
jcharles@MiamiHerald.corn
Call it the $100 million club.
That's the amount each donor nation will have to ante up for a say in Haiti's early recovery under a plan
Haitian President Rene Preval plans to present at an international donors conference in New York at month's
end.
While Haitian and foreign disaster experts were tallying the cost to rebuild after the Jan. 12, 7.0-magnitude
earthquake -- $11.5 billion -- Preval and his advisors have been quietly negotiating the blueprint of the
development plan that will shape Haiti's reconstruction over the next decade.
""It moves it in the right direction,"" Mark Schneider, senior vice president of the Washington D.C.-based
International Crisis Group, said of the plan, which he has seen. ""I've said, the first phase of reconstruction is
a decade. The real test is a generation and hopefully with partnerships both inside and outside of Haiti, it

Haiti recovery blueprint includes foreign donors
BY JACQUELINE CHARLES
jcharles@MiamiHerald.corn
Call it the $100 million club.
That's the amount each donor nation will have to ante up for a say in Haiti's early recovery under a plan
Haitian President Rene Preval plans to present at an international donors conference in New York at month's
end.
While Haitian and foreign disaster experts were tallying the cost to rebuild after the Jan. 12, 7.0-magnitude
earthquake -- $11.5 billion -- Preval and his advisors have been quietly negotiating the blueprint of the
development plan that will shape Haiti's reconstruction over the next decade.
""It moves it in the right direction,"" Mark Schneider, senior vice president of the Washington D.C.-based
International Crisis Group, said of the plan, which he has seen. ""I've said, the first phase of reconstruction is
a decade. The real test is a generation and hopefully with partnerships both inside and outside of Haiti, it
will continue for that time period.""

new Jewish housing project in east Jerusalem during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office said he ordered the probe late Saturday after he met with top Cabinet ministers. While Biden was
visiting earlier this week, Israel's Interior Ministry said it approved plans to build 1,600 homes for Jews in disputed east
Jerusalem. Biden condemned the announcement, which overshadowed his visit. Netanyahu has apologized for the poor
timing of the announcement, but given no sign he will cancel the construction orders. The Palestinians claim east
Jerusalem as their capital, and Israel's annexation of the area is not internationally recognized.

notably that development will be included in the European Action Service (EAS) rather than sitting at a separate desk
(the formula we are seeking rather than the DFID formula). EU defense staff will also be included in the EAS. Indeed,
Ashton chairs the European Council whenever the 27 foreign ministers, development ministers, or defense ministers
meet -- the ultimate integrated frame. She also has control over a number of the smaller development and state-
building budgets, though I gather the biggest development fund is still in dispute between her and the development
commissioner. Apparently, however, the enlargement commissioner took his cues from her on strategy and policy and
then presented his implementation plans to the Council, which is the role she wants. We should be able to build on the
way the EU is organizing in pushing pushing our own integrated frame here.

Miliband was referring to? The language on the nuclear issue reflects where we were last summer -- still on the first
track.
Iran
We are concerned about the aftermath of Iranian Presidential elections. We fully respect the sovereignty of Iran. At the
same time, we deplore post-electoral violence, which led to the loss of lives of Iranian civilians. We express our solidarity
with those who have suffered repression while peacefully demonstrating and urge Iran to respect fundamental human
rights, including freedom of expression, as ensured by the international treaties it has ratified. The crisis should be
settled soon through democratic dialogue and peaceful means on the basis of the rule of law. We call on the Iranian
government to guarantee that the will of the Iranian people is reflected in the electoral process.
We remain committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the issue of Iran's nuclear program and support renewed
efforts to that effect, such as the readiness of the U.S. to enter into direct talks and the invitation from China, France,
Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States to Iran to restart negotiations, as well as the constructive
involvement of other G8 partners in the process. We stress the need for unity of action on the basis of agreed policy. We
sincerely hope that Iran will seize this opportunity to give diplomacy a chance to find a negotiated solution to the
nuclear issue. At the same time we remain deeply concerned over proliferation risks posed by Iran's nuclear programme.
We recognise that Iran has the right to a civilian nuclear programme, but that comes with the responsibility to restore
confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. We strongly urge Iran to cooperate fully with the
IAEA and to comply with the relevant UNSC Resolutions.
Our meeting on the margin of the United Nations General Assembly opening week next September, will be an occasion
for the G8 to take stock of the situation.","communityone","mardi","mars","dmilledix","jakesullivan","nowkend","wkthirteen","topic24","topic8","topic16",2113,247

The report also recommends ensuring the participation of the key opposition party of ousted former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, which was blocked from participating in 2009 legislative contests because of a dispute
over rival candidate lists.
On Tuesday, President Rene Preval fulfilled one recommendation of the report by issuing a signed decree
setting election day for Nov. 28.
But speaking at a news conference in an open-air gazebo alongside the broken remains of the national palace a
day later, Preval told reporters he had no intention of complying with the rest, including changing the election
body, known as the CEP.
""I'm not doing the CEP with international partners. I'm doing the CEP with national partners,"" Preval said. ""The
senator's proposition is inadmissible.""
Seeking to show the council was not ""hand-picked,"" as he said in English, Preval handed out copies of
nomination letters for the panel's members submitted by various national and religious organizations, including
the National Council of Political Parties, Roman Catholic Church and National Confederation of Haitian
Vodou.
He also defended the prohibition on the exiled Aristide's Fanmi Lava1as party in last year's elections, a ban that
came after rival factions of the party submitted competing lists of candidates.
""International donors need to look for an accord with the CEP and the political parties and the factions of Fanmi
Lava1as,"" Preval said. ""We are giving (the parties) the support that they need, and the factions need to figure it
out (for themselves).""
Preval did not discuss the forced resignation of an electoral council member accused of stealing a staffer's pay
or opponents' allegations that the council gave special privileges to the president's newly formed Unity Party
ahead of planned Feb. 28 legislative elections, which were postponed because of the Jan. 12 earthquake that
devastated the capital.","communitytwelve","jeudi","juillet","dmilledix","cherylmills","nowkend","wktwentyseven","topic40","topic13","topic19",2727,362

perfect person to be on the ground dealing with the operation and also translating for the public what is going

cdmHi Cheryl,
Heard you yesterday on NPR. Right on the money in terms of emphasizing coop with GoH and coord with UN et. al. One
thing I am not sure that I mentioned. I looked back and relatively early--4 weeks after Mitch at end Oct 98--we made the
estimate that the US contribut would have to be about $1 b. (when early damage estimate was $6 b.) and that was the
general amount mentioned in the first formin meeting by Madeleine here in early Dec and then the supplemental went to
Congress with more of a breakdown from USAID in early Feb. As soon as you can get an early supplemental to the Hill
while the focus is on Haiti, and our forces are on the ground there, the better chances that it will receive early action. Best,
mark

GLICKMAN STEPPING DOWN FROM MPAA.
Will become President of Refugees International in April; Pisano named as Interim CEO

advocacy organization on refugee crises worldwide. Bob Pisano, President and Chief Operating Officer at the MPAA since
2005, will become interim CEO, while the search continues for Glickman's replacement.
""In making this announcement, I want to thank Barry Meyer, Jim Gianopulos, Brad Grey, Bob Ig-er, Michael Lynton, Ron
Meyer, and the entire MPAA.Board of Directors, for their guidance and leadership. It has been an honor to have worked so
closely with them. I also want to thank Bob Pismo and all the MPAA staff for their dedication during a time of major
transition in our business,"" Glickman said. ""As I look forward to returning to public service and joining Refugees
International, I am proud to look back at what the MPAA has accomplished since I took this job in 2004. We have fought
vigorously on behalf of the 2.4 million Americans and other workers throughout the world whose jobs are based on a vibrant
film and television business. This is a powerful medium that can help make a difference, and I will always value my time
here. For me, perhaps the best thing about the job was the movies. I love movies. And as far as I am concerned, we make
the best movies in the world.""
Barry M. Meyer, Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., praised Glickman's leadership. 'Dan has
demonstrated great leadership in his role as Chairman of the MPAA. He has guided the organization during a time of historic
changes and unprecedented challenges throughout the entertainment industry,"" said Mr. Meyer. `We thank Dan for his
tireless support of the issues facing our businesses, particularly in protecting intellectual property rights in the United States

An Israel Defense Forces search and rescue team extricated a 22-year-old Haitian man on Friday from the
rubble of a three-story building which collapsed as a result of last week's devastating earthquake.
The man was being treated at an lDF field hospital and is currently in stable condition.
Local residents directed the IDF crew to the trapped victim, the lDF said.
""American and French doctors were unable to rescue the trapped man and called upon the Israeli Advertisement

happy to discuss w him as well.
Love your work on women and mobile phones. Hope all is well--HHilary can you give me a telephone number the Qatar Crown Prince can ring you on and he will get in touch.
Alternatively I can get his personal phone number for you. What is the best for you?
Cherie BlairI would be happy to meet w him. How should I follow up to arrange a mutually agreeable time? All the best to you.As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.
IS a meeting possible Or maybe we could set up an initial phone
call.
Can you let me know if this appeals to you at all?

The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN SecretaryÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂGeneral on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council
underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties
and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in
peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses
support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway
and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners
to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.","communityeleven","mardi","juin","dmilledix","humaabedin","nowkend","wktwentytwo","topic8","topic19","topic38",2278,373

I just called Karasin. He agreed that the situation had gotten worse in Osh and Jalalabad today but said the Russian
position is still that sending in foreign troops, whether Russian or CSTO, will be counterproductive and lead to more
violence and bloodshed.
The IL-76s that flew in to Kant today were the EMERCOM/M4C planes he told me about yesterday; they have
humanitarian cargo, primarily doctors and medical equipment. I cited the news reports that a battalion of paratroopers
had gone in -- he said there may be some troops on board to guard the plane or beef up security at Kant, but he was
firm that at this point Russia has no plans to introduce its own forces in the south. The main objective was to stop the
violence through peaceful means; Russia had provided the Kyrgyz forces with additional ""technical means"" for
accomplishing that. He said they hoped this would help Kyrgyz forces get control of the situation, which was their main
goal.
I asked about CSTO planning, and possible UN or OSCE PKFs. He said there is no formal CSTO meeting planned,
although people are consulting via phone. He repeated their hesitation to see any CSTO deployments. They have not
yet considered UN or OSCE PKFs, but if the situation continues to deteriorate, he wouldn't exclude the possibility.
Rushailo is currently in Moscow, but may be sent to Bishkek tomorrow or Tuesday. He agreed to call me if there is any
major change in the situation on the ground, or regarding force deployments. Tomorrow is a Russian holiday but he'll
have his cell phone on.Will keep you posted.I'll doFyi. I think this call makes sense.Jake-

Mrs. Umit is a great admirer of Secretary Clinton's and would be extremely honored to be able to meet with her. I know

The Australian - 19 Jun 10
Embracing everyone from the US to India Greg Sheridan, Foreign editor
GEORGE Yeo, Singapore's Foreign Minister, is one of the most dazzlingly clever people you could meet in Southeast
Asia. Singapore is a society that notoriously produces hardheads in its strategic outlook. But Yeo combines Singapore's
characteristic hard-headedness with a depth of historical understanding and context, as well as a lively human sympathy
for the diversity of the region that surrounds him, which I, at any event, find almost unique. I remember interviewing
him at the height of the East Asian economic crisis in 1997 and asking whether this crisis shattered the idea of Asia as
the growing centre of the global economy, as numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators were then
suggesting. ""No it doesn't,"" Yeo told me. ""At the most it might put back the forecasts by five or 10 years."" It moved the
graph a little to the right, it didn't change the trends. On that, Yeo was absolutely right.
But it is also Yeo's ability to apply the insights of history to the real problems of Asia today which make him formidable.
This week, Yeo spent a few days in Australia and I caught up with him for one of those slightly mesmerising historical
tour de force conversations in which he specialises.
It is no secret Singapore had the most serious reservations about Kevin Rudd's proposal to establish an Asia-Pacific
Community. The Prime Minister wanted the US, India and Russia included in a regional body which could deal with
strategic issues as well as trade and economics. Singapore's hesitation over the Rudd proposal came because it thought
that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which it is a key member, could be sidelined. I asked Yeo whether the
region was now clear on what it wanted its organisations to accomplish. ""We still need a lot more discussion,"" he said.
""The vision is going to change dramatically, with the emergence of China and India on the global stage. The
configuration is evolving much faster than most of us would have preferred. But that's the reality we've got to work
with.
We need a regional architecture which is able to accommodate the stresses. The single most important relationship is
between the US and China. Increasingly, the relationship between India and China is becoming more important. I think
eventually a triangular relationship will decide the big issues of war and peace in Asia this century - the triangle
consisting of the US, China and India.""

food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.

Shortly before 2 PM Nairobi time, William Ruto and the ""No"" team conceded defeat. Saying that ""Kenyans have
spoken"" and that the constitution has been accepted at the referendum, Ruto said that he will now focus on fixing the
contentious issues outlined by the ""No"" team by participating in the implementation process. Somewhat
disingenuously, Ruto is also saying that a ""majority of Kenyans either did not vote or voted against the new
constitution."" He has urged his supporters to remain peaceful and accept the outcome.

will work to address the new constitution's ""moral issues of concern.""

Thank you.
Regards,
Belinda Jackson FarrierIn light of our discussion re. women and reconciliation, I wanted to alert you to a recent incident that has
generated a great deal of concern among Afghan women. Two days ago, a local Taliban commander executed a
pregnant widow for having an ""illicit affair"" (the man was not punished). While there are varying accounts of
the incident, the authorities have confirmed that she was shot in the head several times after being flogged up to
200 times in Qadis district (which is completely under the control of the Taliban) of Badghis.Government
authorities have condemned the incident, noting that due process was not carried out.
In meetings today, Afghan women leaders, including some who in the past accepted reconciliation as inevitable,
expressed both fear and bitterness over the incident and shared concerns that such brutality against
women would be far more prevalent if reconciliation occurred. They noted frustration about the lack of
transparency in the government's reintegration and reconciliation processes. A number of women questioned
what the government is willing to bargain in order to achieve a peace settlement and the extent to which it is
prepared to roll women's rights back to appease the Taliban. They noted that women's rights are treated as a
nuisance by the government leadership rather than as an important element of the peace process.
Melanne also met with President Karzai and was dismayed when he told her that there weren't any women's
names on the list of potential candidates for the High Peace Council. Stanekzai is said to have come up with a
list of 300 names (FRIC reports that women were on the list) that has been wittled down to about 30 names.
While the list is far from being finalized, President Karzai does not currently appear to be prioritizing women's
inclusion in the body--despite the fact that the APRP commits to it. Afghan women have called for 20% to 30%
inclusion of women in the High Peace Council and the Joint Secretariat. We will be meeting with Stanekzai
trmw and raise this issue.

5640,"philippe.reines@univ-tlse3.fr","2010-07-23T04:00:00+00:00","WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration targeted key leaders of Afghanistan's Taliban with new financial
sanctions Thursday in a move that could complicate relations with Pakistan and Afghan efforts to reconcile with
insurgents.
The action by the Treasury Department will freeze the militants' assets, ban travel and trigger an arms embargo. It
follows similar action by the United Nations earlier this week, and comes after calls from Gen. David Petraeus, the top
military commander in Afghanistan, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for
sanctions against Afghan insurgent commanders operating in Pakistan.
Taken together, the U.S. and U.N. sanctions prohibit any financial transactions of the terror leaders in U.N. member
countries, putting additional pressure on Pakistan to take broader actions against the Taliban militants.
Three financial kingpins were targeted with sanctions, including a key member of the Haqqani network, which,directs
operations against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan from safe havens in Pakistan. Among those sanctioned
Thursday was Nasiruddin Haqqani, an emissary for the Haqqani Network and brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani who leads
the group with his father, Jalaluddin.
Others sanctioned included Gul Agha Ishakzai, the head of the Taliban's financial commission and Amir Abdullah, the
former treasurer to captured Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader. The sanctions placed on the three leaders as
terrorists would deprive them of the assets they need to fund their terror operations, said Adam J. Szubin, director of
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""We will continue to aggressively work to expose and dismantle the financial
networks of terrorist groups in support of the president's goal of a stable Afghanistan,"" he said.
According to officials, lshakzai is the head of the Taliban's financial commission, has collected money for suicide attacks
in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and has been involved in the disbursement of funds for Taliban fighters. He has served as a
main financial officer and close adviser to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. Abdullah has reportedly traveled to
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya and the United Arab Emirates to raise money for the Taliban and facilitate meetings and
communications with key leaders. Nasiruddin Haqqani has collected funds for the Haqqani group, including from al-
Qaida. Last week, Gen. David Petraeus, the top military commander in Afghanistan, urged officials to add commanders
from the Haqqani network to the terrorist list. At the time, administration officials said a review was under way, largely
accelerated after the May 1 failed Times Square bombing. The man who has pleaded guilty in the New York incident,
Pakistani-born American Faisal Shahzad, said he trained with the Pakistani Taliban to build bombs, then returned to the
U.S. to launch an attack that would avenge attacks on Muslims by U.S. forces overseas.","communityone","vendredi","juillet","dmilledix","philippereines","nowkend","wkthirty","topic13","topic1","topic31",2981,38

Dear Trustees and Trustee Associates,
I am writing to share an update on Fr. Beirne's health. Fr. Beirne called this morning to let me know that his
cancer has reached a stage where he has made the decision not to have any further clinical intervention. He
prefers to live out the time he has remaining, six months by the doctors' projections, without the sapping of
his energy and other side effects posed by his recent treatments. I have his permission to share this sad
news with you. You may write to Fr. Beirne at Murray-Weigel Hall where he is now living (see address
below) or phone him on his cell phone at
Murray-Weigel Hall
515 E. Ford ham Road
Bronx, NY 10458-5029
I am sure that you join me in offering prayers for Fr. Beirne as he faces the challenges his illness presents in
his final months with us.
Sincerely,

5843,"samuel.(""sandy"").berger@univ-tlse3.fr","","Congratulations on the resumption of direct talks. As evidenced by your activity over the
past several weeks your involvement in the peace process inevitably has deepened as the
need for high-level U.S. intervention has grown. I believe that is a positive result. But
the more fundamental issue remains what your role can and should be going forward in
order to maximize chances of diplomatic success.
I. . State of Play
As the U.S. embarks on the next stage in the Israeli-Palestinian process, it faces a series
of tactical and strategic challenges regarding policy, politics and personality.
1. At a policy level, the meager results of indirect talks and difficulties in transitioning to
direct talks have underscored the lack of trust between the two sides as well as
existing substantive gaps. With direct talks begin in the coming days, one obstacles
will have been removed, but several remain. Some or all of these may have been
resolved in connection with gaining agreement to direct talks.
a. How to handle the renewal or non-renewal of Israel's settlement moratorium?
b. What is the goal of the direct talks and is there a consensus on this matter
between the parties? A comprehensive agreement on permanent (CAPS) that
covers all the details? A framework agreement on permanent status (FAPS)
that outlines the governing parameters, along the lines of the 2000 Clinton
parameters? Or, less ambitiously, a short (one or two page) statement of
principles?
c. What role will the U.S. play? Will George or another U.S. official be present
in all meetings? Will Netanyahu accept that? Is there an argument for
allowing the two sides to deal with one another without any intermediary, at
least for a while, so that they do not seek to play to the U.S.?
d. What will the U.S. do in the event of an impasse or breakdown? Should it
present bridging proposals and, if so, when?
e. How much work should be done, in parallel and simultaneously with the
direct talks, between the U.S. and the Palestinians on the one hand and the
U.S. and Israel on the other?
Beyond those questions, I am persuaded the most important factor is and is likely to
remain what Netanyahu is prepared to do. You have witnessed first-hand how
difficult it can be to deal with the Palestinians and the Arab world more generally;
how fragile is Abbas's political position; how indecisive they can be. Still, at bottom,
we have a relatively clear sense of their positions on the core issues should we ever
reach a moment of truth. That is not the case with Netanyahu who either does not
know himself or is not prepared to share and who, until now, has neither felt the
urgency to reach a deal nor the discomfort of the status quo.","communitytwelve",NA,NA,NA,"samuel(""sandy"")berger","nowkend","wkNA","topic8","topic23","topic4",2700,3

5907,"huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr","2010-09-16T04:00:00+00:00","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel approved a new strategic nuclear arms control treaty with Russia on
September 16, advancing one of President Barack Obama's main foreign policy priorities to an uncertain future in the
full Senate. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 14-4 to approve the new START treaty. The full Senate must
consent to the agreement before it can go into effect, but with Congress in the hottest part of the political season
before mid-term congressional elections, it is unclear when the treaty will get a vote on the Senate floor. The
agreement signed by Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in April commits former Cold War foes
Washington and Moscow to reducing deployed nuclear warheads by about 30 percent.
It picked up some Republican support in the foreign relations committee from Senators Bob Corker and Johnny lsakson.
They voted aye along with Richard Lugar, previously the only Senate Republican who had publicly supported the
treaty. But since 67 votes are needed to meet the two-thirds minimum required for treaties to pass the full Senate, at
least eight Republicans will have to vote for it. Most Republicans have remained uncommitted for months, leaving the
treaty's fate in limbo. The weak Republican support to date and the fact the Senate has a lot of business to take care of
before the congressional November 2 elections, makes the new START treaty a likely candidate for the ""lame duck""
session to follow.
Obama wants the new START ratified this year as part of his ""reset"" of relations with Russia and a step toward his goal of
a world without nuclear weapons. Russia must also ratify the treaty, but is waiting to see what the United States will
do. The treaty is broadly supported as an important step forward in arms control by former senior security officials from
both Republican and Democratic administrations. But some Republican senators say they worry it may limit U.S. missile
defenses, and some want Obama to promise to spend more money modernizing the nuclear weapons that remain.","communityeleven","jeudi","septembre","dmilledix","humaabedin","nowkend","wkthirtyeight","topic32","topic3","topic24",2061,373

Remarks to staff of the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and, separately, to members of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs
Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)
1 September 2010, Oslo, Norway
You have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East, with an emphasis on the prospects for
peace in the Holy Land. You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs, especially Saudi
Arabia, to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at this ministry.
The declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis and
Palestinian Arabs to reach consequential, positive results. The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace, not another
deceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive, so-called ""peace process."" And if that one step forward in Oslo in
1993 was followed by several steps backwards, there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened.
There can be no doubt about the importance of today's topic. The ongoing conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbs
the world's conscience as well as its tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of European
colonialism. In the post-colonial era, tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became, by
degrees, the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. It
stimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of the Cold War, the
interaction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It is
increasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations.
For better or ill, my own country, the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in this
contest. American policies, more than those of any other external actor, have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds in
the Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies and actions in the Middle
East thus affect much more than that region.
Yet, as I will argue, the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance. It has failed to involve
parties who are essential to peace. It has acted on Israel's behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regional
support for peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress. Its concept of a ""peace
process"" has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There are
alternatives to tomorrow's diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And, as Norway has shown, there is a role for
powers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land.","communitytwelve","jeudi","septembre","dmilledix","sidneyblumenthal","nowkend","wkthirtysix","topic8","topic12","topic35",3013,94

sticker for the speech. How about ""A New American Century""? We cd take on the critics directly and right up front and
make the argument this way (a lot of this is already in the intro, but wd need to be pulled together differently).
1)We live in a new age of diplomacy - we are seeing the limits of force and we face collective problems that require
bringing together a wider array of key players rather than any one nation dictating a solution. Active diplomacy is the
only option. (This is the argument david rothkopf was making to mark landler when we thought landler was doing a
profile - it resonated v well w/ landler.)
2) The U.S. is uniquely suited to lead in these circumstances. a) In situations where many nations must be brought
together that do not trust each other, we are still seen as the most honest broker. b) In situations where many nations
are sitting around the table contemplating a common problem, someone has to step forward and take responsibility for
mobilizing action (which also includes the risk of failure). We are the nation most willing to do that, both because of our
history and our values. (Here is where S can offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting for us to do something) c) in a
world of global problems, we are the most global nation, with the greatest global reach, resources, and connections.
3) We see global leadership not only as a responsibility but also as an opportunity, b/c of our native confidence,
optimism and faith that problems can be solved. We have a chance to shape a genuinely global agenda, focusing on
development as well as traditional national security issues, and mobilizing business and civil society as well as
governments. This is our time.
The speech would then go on, as it does now, to outline all the ways in which we are building relationships and solving
problems now with traditional allies and new powers on the global landscape while building a longer term architecture
of cooperation that is both truly global and adapted to solving 21st century problems.

Americans Give GOP Edge on Most Election
Issues
Greatest Republican advantages on terrorism, immigration,
federal spending
by Jeffrey M. Jones
PRINCETON, NJ -- A new USA Today/Gallup poll finds Americans saying the Republicans in Congress would do a better
job than the Democrats in Congress of handling seven of nine key election issues. The parties are essentially tied on
healthcare, with the environment being the lone Democratic stren th.
The Republicans' advantage on most issues is an indication of the currently favorable political environment for the party.
Of particular note is the parity between the two parties on healthcare, an issue on which Americans historically have
viewed the Democrats as superior.
A similar USA Today/Gallup poll conducted in October 2006, just prior to Democrats' major gains in that fall's elections,
highlights the potential implications of these findings. That poll, which includes several issues measured in the current
survey, found the Democrats leading on all eight issues tested at that time, including some usual Republican strengths
like terrorism and moral values.
With Republicans now having the advantage on most issues, the party may be poised to make major gains in
congressional seats, just as the Democrats did in 2006. Indeed, Gallup tracking of registered voters' preferences in the
2010 generic ballot for Congress continues to find the Republicans ahead of the Democrats, as it has for the past five
weeks.
The Economy Matters Most
The Democrats' advantage on the issue of the environment is likely not something the party can leverage to improve its
2010 electoral fortunes, as Americans rank it at the bottom of the list in terms of its importance to their vote. Rather,
economic concerns are paramount, with a majority of Americans rating the economy, jobs, and federal spending (along
with government corruption) as extremely important.","communitytwelve","samedi","septembre","dmilledix","sidneyblumenthal","wkend","wkthirtysix","topic13","topic32","topic1",1997,94

settlements in the occupied territories, including even the ""natural growth"" of existing settlements. At the time,
the administration called settlement activity ""illegitimate"" and appeared ready to go to the mat with Israel to
show just how strongly the United States believed that settlements impede peace.
But now, the administration says it is prepared to pay off Israel to freeze only some of its settlement activity,
and only temporarily. For the first time in memory, the United States is poised to reward Israel for its bad
behavior.","communityone","vendredi","novembre","dmilledix","jakesullivan","nowkend","wkfortyseven","topic8","topic27","topic33",1235,247

to him yesterday.I will call--I'm copying Lauren to work to set up call.Madame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting and striking
police, and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same, the army finally rescued him at 9pm last night. Some
military units, including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. The police also occupied the national
congress. As the rescue took place, the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefs of Staff issued a statement supporting the
president, and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law ""in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the
maximum authority of the three branches."" Things are now calm.
Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South American presidents at the
call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to support Correa. Several, including Garcia
and Santos, called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. Moratinos tried to reach you at around 6pm last evening to
convey that news, I took the call.
As you know, we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish, which was re-
played frequently. I strongly recommend that you call Correa today to reiterate U.S. support for his government and to
wish him well.
He will appreciate it but, more broadly, it sends a signal that the United States supports the constitutional order and
rejects any attempt to undermine it. Chavez in Buenos Aires predictably declared that we were behind the unrest. We
have prepared a call sheet for you.

cdmPlease Pass to the Secretary
Madame Secretary,
A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two
bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an
attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families
were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a
very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.
U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on
understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in
Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August
20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to
school while we complete this security review.
I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More
broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to
function in Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this, and have sought her help as well to address consulate
security.
Consulate personnel are currently on ""authorized departure"" and have the option to send their families to a U.S.
location. Pat Kennedy is in close touch on these matters.

official Palestinian report asserting the Western Wall, one of Judaism's holiest sites, is not Jewish. Al-Mutawakil Taha,
deputy information minister in the Palestinian Authority, published a five-page study disputing Jews' reverence of the
shrine as a retaining wall of the compound of Biblical Jewish Temples destroyed centuries ago. ""Denial of the
connection between the Jewish people and the Western Wall by the Palestinian Authority's Ministry of Information is
baseless and scandalous,"" Netanyahu said in a statement issued by the prime minister's office. ""The Israeli government
expects the leaders of the Palestinian Authority to renounce the document and condemn it, and to stop twisting
historical facts,"" he said. In the report, Taha wrote the Western wall is a ""Muslim wall and an integral part of al-Aqsa
mosque and Haram al-Sharif,"" a position echoing past statements by the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Taha
issued the document after Israel approved five-year renovation plan for the Western Wall area.

Bank branches throughout the country to withdraw funds. While the situation is still orderly, there is mounting
frustration--particularly in the provinces-- that the bank is unable to give people back their full deposits, forcing
them to repeatedly return and stand in long lines to withdraw their money in increments. On Saturday close to
70 million dollars was withdrawn. Hajis (people who have provided funds to go to Haj) are also demanding
their money bank. The overall sense is that it is a matter of days before the government will be forced to take
over KB.
-There are also reports of security people employed at KB shaking people withdrawing money. The government
has responded by replacing KB security with ANSF and NDS guards.
-On a positive note, the adverse situation in KB bank has not affected the other banks. The majority of people
withdrawing funds from KB are opening new accounts in Afghan International Bank, Aziz Bank, among others.
The heads of these banks have successfully projected corruption at KB as something that is associated with the
leadership of KB rather than a more systematic problem affecting other banks. People are also turning to other
banks because the security situation leaves them worried about keeping their savings at home.
-In the very short run, the government has come out ahead in this crisis. People are reassured that President
Karzai has actively taken control of the situation and is showing leadership. But this is clearly the biggest crisis
that President Karzai has faced in the last nine years. A number of the political elite are privately noting that the
situation could escalate and people could turn against the government once they feel the effects of this crisis.
Corruption, which President Karzai has cast a western concern, is now seen by Afghans as a fundamental
problem within the government.
-While the majority of media outlets have been cautious to not criticize the Government, fearing that it could
lead to further instability, this is expected to change in the coming days. Abdullah Abdullah has been one of the
few voices that has come out and noted that the Government was an active agent in the KB scandal, pointing

Ankara Is WikiLeaks Epicenter (Hurriyet)
Turkish media is awash in Wikileaks revelations, with most focused on the 7,918 cables - the largest number for any one
country - emanating from the US Embassy in Ankara. All news channels NW and CNN Turk reported that PM Erdogan,
as he departed for Libya on 11/29, told reporters ""let the Wikileaks show what it has and, then, ...we can learn how serious
or unserious these reports are because the credibility of Wikileaks is in question. So, currently we are waiting for them to
print what they have. Then we can make an evaluation and necessary statement."" Pro-government Sabah columnist
Mehmet Barlas asks ""Are Wikileaks Docs More Striking than Reality?"" and opines ""It's hard to understand why the State
Department has panicked this much. After all, this information is gathered from the facts, media, and different
sources. What could remain secret in an information age?"" Ashi Aydintasbas in Miffiyet Over the past year, the AK Party
government had a volatile relationship with the Obama Administration. The documents show that Americans do not see
the government in Ankara as a real ally, and that they have concerns. Unlike the style used in bilateral meetings, a much
tougher language is used backstage. The fact that the Turkish foreign minister knows his interlocutors characterize him as
'dangerous' at a time he's in Washington will stiffen the distrustfulness between the two capitals."" In ""Ankara WikiLeaks
Epicenter,"" mainstream Hurriyefs front page headline report mirrors most Turkish media reports in saying that the
documents show that the US Embassy in Ankara views Turkey ""as a country with divisions in leadership"" and that ""Turkey
cannot be trusted because it was not likely to join the EU and was heading to an Islamist future."" Hurriyet spotlights reports
that purportedly say Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan had ""incompetent"" advisors and was pursuing a secret, Islamist agenda
and that describe him as ""stubborn, workaholic and perfectionist,"" but ""not a tyrant."" Hurriyet concludes that reports indicated
that that the US views Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu as an ""exceptionally dangerous"" figure and that ""America had
been alarmed by his aspirations to reassert the influence the Ottoman Empire used to exert on the region."" In ""9/11 of","communityeleven","lundi","novembre","dmilledix","humaabedin","nowkend","wkfortyeight","topic33","topic19","topic8",3561,373

As we discussed during your salon dinner with Steve Clemons at Nora's, I am developing a practical strategy of
""off-shore/on-shore balancing"" that would involve key USG agencies.
As the attached proposal explains, the new strategy is substantially different from previous historical constructs
in the literature on American grand strategy and offers important advantages to improve our position in
Afghanistan and other regions in the world in the coming years.
Going forward, I would like make sure I have State's views correct. If you and your staff could meet with me

(AFP) ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7 hours ago
WASHINGTON ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â US President Barack Obama Thursday said he hoped that a landmark nuclear weapons deal
with Russia would win Congress approval before the end of this year.
The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) was negotiated earlier this year to replace a similar treaty
which expired at the end of December.
Obama appealed to Republicans to help approve the treaty when Congress returns on November 15, after the
party put up stiff opposition to the new deal fearing it could hamper US missile defense plans.
""This is not a traditionally Democratic or Republican issue, but, rather, an issue of American national security,""
Obama said at a cabinet meeting, two days after Republicans posted strong gains in congressional elections.
""I'm hopeful that we can get that done.., and send a strong signal to Russia that we're serious about reducing
nuclear arsenals, but also send a signal to the world that we're serious about non-proliferation,"" Obama said.
The new Congress takes office in January, with Republicans set to take control of the House of Representatives
and to add members to the Senate. So the next two months are known as a ""lame duck"" session, in which
outgoing lawmakers often shy away from major legislation.
But START was facing trouble even in the current Congress. Under the US constitution, treaties need the
approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The START treaty -- signed by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Obama at an elaborate ceremony in
Prague in April -- restricts each nation to a maximum of 1,550 deployed warheads, a cut of about 30 percent
from a limit set in 2002.
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed Obama's appeal, urging the Senate to ratify a treaty to ensure the
resumption of inspections of Russia's arsenal.
His press secretary, Geoff Morrell, told reporters that Gates ""and many other former defense secretaries and
national security officials, from both parties, have frequently voiced their strong belief that this treaty is","communitytwelve","jeudi","novembre","dmilledix","cherylmills","nowkend","wkfortyfive","topic32","topic3","topic24",2218,362

peace talks.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called President Shimon Peres to offer greetings for the Jewish holiday of Rosh
Hashanah. During the telephone conversation, Peres pleaded with Abbas to ""trust [Prime Minister Benjamin]
Netanyahu.""
Against the backdrop of recently relaunched direct peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, Peres urged
the Palestinian president ""not to abandon the talks before peace is achieved. There is no one more suited than you to
achieve peace for your people, and for the entire region.""
Abbas and other senior Palestinian negotiators have threatened to quit the U.S.-backed negotiations if Israel should
resume construction in West Bank settlements. Last November, Netanyahu declared a 10-month moratorium on
construction in settlements, but the freeze is set to expire at the end of this month, and it is not yet clear whether it will
be renewed.
""Even if things don't appear perfect,"" Peres told Abbas, ""the path toward peace and an independent Palestinian state is
certainly preferable to an ongoing conflict and bloodshed. Even if there will be crises and disagreements, and the road
will seem imperfect, I'm sure that new and creative solutions can be achieved.""
Abbas replied that ""we're serious and our goal is to achieve a peace agreement as soon as possible."" To this Peres
responded saying ""I'm sure Netanyahu is a trustworthy partner.""
Earlier, Abbas spoke with Netanyahu by phone. The two leaders offered mutual greetings for the holidays, the Muslim
Eid el Fitr and Jewish Rosh Hashanah.","communityeleven","jeudi","septembre","dmilledix","humaabedin","nowkend","wkthirtyseven","topic8","topic17","topic5",1671,373

First, of course your instinct is right to attempt to save the situation. I think, however, it is
fraught. Being, right easily might be worse than being wrong. (Doing absolutely nothing,
meanwhile, would bear no cost, just to note the benefits of irresponsibility.) So, how any advice
can be proposed without potential pitfalls is a mystery to me. It may be that Bill delivers the
message in public, on the stump. This message, on extremism and the GOP, ought to be given
soon, on Labor Day or immediately thereafter. Urgently, the momentum of the far right needs to
be blunted; it must be redefined; the political discussion must be shaped and shifted; and the
GOP must be put on the defensive and begin to pay the price.

survivors of a deadly 2008 mosque bombing as a condition of his release in a scripted event that could carry propaganda
value at home. Iranian authorities did not immediately explain their demand for 71-year-old Reza Taghavi to pay homage
in the southern city of Shiraz and personally acknowledge an attack in which he denies having any connection. But it
would fit neatly into possible Iranian attempts to squeeze multiple messages from Taghavi's October 16 release after 29
months in custody. Taghavi, accompanied by his wife and lawyer, fulfilled his pledge to visit the site of the mosque
bombing. They later met with survivors, including people who lost relatives in the attack.
The U.S. and allies fear Iran could use its nuclear fuel labs to eventually produce weapons-grade material. Iran says it
only seeks peaceful energy-producing reactors. Taghavi's attorney, former U.S. diplomat Pierre Prosper, said he
purposely left American officials out of the negotiations to avoid having his client become a bargaining chip. ""Our strategy
was to make sure that our dialogue with the [Iranian] government was between us and them,"" said Prosper, who held five
rounds of direct talks with Iranian envoys since Taghavi was jailed.","communityeleven","dimanche","octobre","dmilledix","humaabedin","wkend","wkfortytwo","topic24","topic17","topic35",1420,373

so late we are paying more now to build it quicker).
Where it will come from?
A- Right now we have three big companies talking to us in the range o each - Monsanto, Disney, and Oracle.
Haier may go from . If two or three come thru big we are done.
B-We also have a number of other companies like Invitrogen, Hormel, Mattel and Major League Baseball in the
range.I don't think I made any progress. What will it mean if we can't raise the remaining $? Where else can we try?

General Jim Jones has spent a lifetime serving our country with honor and distinction. In war and in peace, from foreign
battlefields to the highest levels of our government, he has exemplified the best traditions of the Marine Corps and the
United States. I have been honored to serve with him and to call him my friend. As National Security Advisor he brought
a steady hand and clear vision to an unforgiving agenda. His leadership was crucial in winding down the combat mission
in Iraq, refocusing the war in Afghanistan, and advancing our nation's interests and values around the world. America is
more secure and the world is more stable because of Jim's tireless efforts. He will be sorely missed, but I am pleased
that Jim will now be able to spend more time with his wife Diane and their wonderful family.
General Jones leaves Marine-sized shoes to fill, but we are fortunate that a public servant as talented and dedicated as
Tom Donilon has agreed to take on the task. I have known Tom for many years and he brings deep experience and
valuable skills to this crucial job. He has a proven ability to translate big-picture vision into concrete action. As Deputy
National Security Advisor, Tom has been a trusted member of our team and has contributed to every major policy
decision. I appreciate his support for the State Department and our diplomacy and development efforts around the
world and I look forward to working closely with him to implement the President's agenda.","communityeleven","vendredi","octobre","dmilledix","humaabedin","nowkend","wkfortyone","topic15","topic35","topic7",1559,373

By EMILY PARKER
In 2007 I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper. We talked in his elegant home,
surrounded by thousands of books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine. Then he proceeded to
discuss why he believes that literature can change the world.
Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize is a great victoryÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âand not just for a talented and prolific author. His work is
perhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politics,
or who claim that they have ""no time"" for fiction.
In a New Republic essay in 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature ""an important place in the life
of nations."" He wrote, 'Without it, the critical mind, which is the real engine of historical change and the best
protector of liberty, would suffer an irreparable loss.""
Mr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect his deep, personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the value
of individual liberty. He is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes, but I would argue that he
is among the most successful.
Columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady on the anti-Communist Peruvian writer.
A case in point is ""Conversation in the Cathedral,"" the work that Mr. Vargas Llosa has said he would rescue
first from a fire. The novel is set in Peru, in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the 1950s, which
is when Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe how
dictatorships impregnate ""every act of life.""
To demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright. The book
opens with a grim landscape of ""uneven and faded buildings"" and describes ""dull and defeated eyes at the
tables of Zela bar, hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer."" The narrative, which rapidly jumps from
past to present, describes a stalled, confused world. You don't know who to trust.","communityeleven","vendredi","octobre","dmilledix","anne-marieslaughter","nowkend","wkfortyone","topic21","topic22","topic29",2376,34

creatively on what they want..
Depdg on amount, they get on the big wall of contributors, we show multiple scenes of NYC in the shows and displays,
they can use the wonderful VIP lounge/auditorium to have NYC day or week at the Expo - the rockettes, Broadway goes
to China, commercial diplomacy, mtgs betwn NYC and Chinese officials, .getting SME's access to China etc. We could
really be creative.
LA, San Fran, San Antonio already in, chicago on way...
As you know the general theme is ""Better Cities, Better Lives"". How can NYC not be repped? They cam brag about their
innovations.If a city gives $ do they put up display/exhibits?This will be an important two weeks to nail down these big companies. We are negotiating with them now about
possible options. I'll keep you posted.
May be good to mention this to Mayor Bloomberg if you run into him or see him. Doctoroff gave us
Bloomberg, LLC but he thght the Mayor may be interested for the city.What else can I do to help?Google has been wierd about this whole deal but this whole Espo experience has been fascinating. Some companies will
say absolutely no for months (Qualcomm, Bloomberg, J&J) and then pop out of nowhere and say yes. Others like All are
in for and then decide not to give us a penny. Therefore we have to keep bugging these guys.
We WILL raise the money. We are at $54M+ (this wk Hawaii came in for $500k and Bloomberg LLC and need $7M

each - Monsanto, Disney, and Oracle.
B- We also have a number of other companies like Invitrogen, Hormel, Mattel and Major League Baseball in the

C- Interestingly the cities and states are going to their private funders and trying to raise money on their own to
promote their jurisdictions - Chicago, Houston, Georgia, Montana, TN. (In the past, over 20 states participated with
public funds but current budgets are tough). Maybe a chat w Mayor Bloomberg would be worthwhile. For example, I
spoke to the University of WA and they will probably get benefactors to cosponsor at $250k making them the only
university represented.
D- We have approached groups like Pharma and the fashion industry thru Diane von Furstenburg to get them to bundle
smaller companies and both have agreed to do it. I met w DVL and she wants you to know that she is very excited about
helping (they are in the range).
E-We have talked to the elusive Chamber of Commerce again about getting SME's to raise $2-3M in smaller increments.
They are contemplating it.
Finally the two obvious industries that are not involved are the banks (and we know why) and the insurance companies
who are starting to look into the market over there.
Anyway, I did not mean to go on and on but that's where we stand and these are the potential areas to tap. We'll get
there.I don't think I made any progress. What will it mean if we can't raise the remaining $? Where else can we try?

I got your email address in a message from my good friend, Kathleen Townsend, several months ago but have never
wanted to bother you directly. However, as the former head of humanitarian operations at USAID under Pres. Clinton, I
thought it appropriate to commend you and your colleagues on the excellent job that is being done in the early days of
the USG response to the tragedy in Haiti. The deployment of Coast Guard and SouthComm resources, the immediate
organization of an interdepartmental group to coordinate USG efforts, the deployment of multiple USAID urban search
and rescue units as well as a DART, and the ability to make these decisions without delay is impressive. Managing
information flow with early statements by the Pres. and Sec. followed by your press conference on relief plans
effectively focused attention on the US leadership role. Please pass on my ""good job"" to whomever has been leading
this effort. It's as good as I have seen from the USG. Let me know if there is anyway I can be of help.

We arrived at the general hospital last night with 1500 people sick or dying with 40 percent needing surgery. It has no
water electricity or food and very limited surgical suites or supplies It the largest and most well known public hospital in
the city and according to NH and paul farmer needs to be supported and it's infrastucture needs to be rebuilt.
Right now we have surgeons but not enough operating rooms set up. We
desperately need to get a generator and fuel and surgical lights and surgery supplies not just first aid. There are
hundreds including children with festering wounds needing amputation and emergency
surgical care. The doctors nurses and patients have no food or water.
Can you help get the infrastructure of electricity water and a medical hospital tent for post op patients. We are
operating with headlamps and hacksaws rinsed with alcohol.
If we have the electricity and water we can open 11 operating rooms tomorrow if we get what we need. Can the
military help ASAP and for security of equipment and medication.
Until this morning when did the first amuptation there was almost no surgery happening at all here in the city and B6
none at the General.
Five days after the quake with no acute surgical care wounds are

The Secretary's messages at the meeting were outstanding, from OHR's point of view. Inzko is elated - particular with her
firm support for 5+2 and for judicious use of Bonn Powers (BP). Other than from the U.S., and usually from the UK, there
has been, at most, strong reluctance in the Quint to support BP use -- even when there are direct challenges to Dayton
and the functionality of the BH state. We have also sensed some Quint backsliding on 5+2. Although he missed the
opportunity you gave him to make the pitch directly, he later asked me to convey to you his hope that the Secretary would
be willing to help shore up European support for 5+2 and BP with key PIC colleagues -- especially from Quint countries
(Germany, France, Italy in particular). We certainly foresee a need to employ BP on the State Property issue, unless
Dodik abruptly alters course. lnzko is grateful as well to the Secretary for her offer to speak with Lady Ashton.

If President Obama decides to move Hillary Clinton to the Pentagon as part of a mid-term shake-up, he can
count on some unlikely support -- from Newt Gingrich.
""She is knowledgeable, she is tough, I think that she'd be a very aggressive defender of the military in terms of
what it needs, its budgets and its concerns,"" Gingrich told me.
The Washington rumor mill has been talking about Clinton moving over to the Pentagon for some time -- but
the secretary of state told my colleague Cynthia McFadden that she has ""made it clear that I love the job I
have.""
The former speaker of the House said he was impressed with Clinton when they served together on the
Transformation Advisory Group for the Joint Forces Command.

Graham, the Director of the Army Jag School in Charlottesville. This trip builds on our January visit in which
we met with various Israeli officials, including the Chief of Staff of the IDF, to discuss follow-up to the
Goldstone Report.
Our approach has been to offer our support and willingness to work with the Government of Israel to reframe
the public debate from defensive (responding to Goldstone or Flotilla reports and resolutions at the UN, etc.) to
a more pro-active narrative focused on the challenges of fighting an urban or asymmetrical war. We are

Iraqi Government Coalition Agreement
I applaud [rag's political leaders for working together to agree on an inclusive government that
represents the will of the Iraqi people and moves their country forward. Today's coalition
decision is a milestone in the emergence of the new Iraq and it is a testament to the
determination of the Iraqi people to build their own democracy, a goal only they can achieve.
This agreement ensures meaningful representation for the election winners, encompassing all of
Iraq's ethnic and sectarian communities. It also includes critical provisions for power-sharing
and other reforms, including revisions to the to the de-Ba'athification process. In addition, Iraqi
leaders have agreed to establish a National Council of Strategic Policies. This important body
will serve as a steering group in the areas of defense policy, foreign affairs, economic policy,
and other strategic issues.
As Iraqis continue their progress, they will have a committed and consistent partner in the
United States. Our relationship is rooted in mutual respect and mutual interest. We look
forward to expanding our cooperation under the Strategic Framework Agreement and together
pursuing our shared goal of building a long-term, multidimensional relationship between our

Morales. Perhaps we could discuss tomorrow.Rough translation of the points below:
Evo Morales announced today that his government will ask for an emergency meeting at the UN to ""reject the U.S.
military occupation"" in Haiti, according to Spanish news agency EFE.
""It is not possible that the U.S. is using a natural disaster to invade and occupy Haiti,"" said Morales, who qualified
as ""inhumane, savage, and opportunist"" the deployment of troops in the Caribbean island.
""We'll ask the UN, via our Foreign Ministry, for an emergency meeting to reject this military occupation of the U.S.
in Haiti,"" announced Morales.
Morales recalled that President Obama has guaranteed in international fora that he wants partners and respectful
diplomatic relations with other countries. ""You don't achieve this (partners, diplomatic relations) with military
occupation, or troops, or bases,"" he said and expects ""a pronouncement by the peoples of the world and social forces
rejecting this intervention and military occupation in Haiti.""
Morales also asked ""how much money, food and water"" will be destined to the 12,000 soldiers the U.S. sent to
Haiti and noted that this money ""should be spend on the victims.""Following up on this, President Morales has now said he will call for an emergency meeting at the UN to ""reject the U.S.
military occupation of Haiti."" I've alerted 10. I'll reach out to Labor and G staff to offer a briefing, will keep you looped
in.
EVO MORALES PIDE REUNION DE EMERGENCIA PARA REPUDIAR Y RECHAZAR A EEUU EN HAITI, INFORMA EFE
Evo Morales anunciO hoy que su Gobierno pedira a Naciones Unidas una reunion de emergencia para ""repudiar y
rechazar la ocupacion militar de Estados Unidos"" en Haiti, informa la agencia espariola EFE.
""No es posible que Estados Unidos use una desgracia natural para invadir y ocupar militarmente Haiti"", dijo
Morales, quien califico de ""inhumano, salvaje y oportunista"" el despliegue de las fuerzas armadas estadounidenses en la
isla caribefia.
""Vamos a pedir mediante la cancilleria a las Naciones Unidas una reunion de emergencia para repudiar y rechazar
esta ocupaciOn militar de Estados Unidos hacia Haiti"", anuncio Morales.
Morales recordo que el mandatario de Estados Unidos, Barack Obama, ha garantizado en foros internacionales que
desea tener socios y relaciones diplomaticas de respeto mutuo con el resto de 'Daises. ""Ser socios o tener relaciones
diplomaticas no se hace con ocupacion militar, ni con tropas militares, ni con bases militares"", dijo y espera ""un
pronunciamiento de todos los pueblos del mundo y de las fuerzas sociales rechazando esta intervention y ocupaciOn
militar en Haiti"".
Morales se preguntO tambien ""cuanta plata, cuantos alimentos o cuanta agua"" se van a destinar para abastecer a
los 12.000 soldados que Estados Unidos ha mandado a Haiti y considero que ese dinero ""deberia gastarse en los
damnificados"" por el terremoto y no en los militares.

NATO summit, softening its stance after reassurances from France and Germany, a source close to participants said on

The source said that Medvedev himself would attend the NATO summit, which is due to unveil a new strategic plan

This email is UNCLASSIFIED.PJ-- Senator Menendez and company are released their report on Lockerbie/Megrahi release timed for tomorrow, the

The plan worked perfectly. Gordon made the speech in the late afternoon. Cameron felt compelled to support both the
deal and the timing. Shaun called Lou Susman beforehand and Susman made a helpful call to Cameron ""seeking
clarification"" an hour and a half before the event.
Now, Reg Empey is boxed in. He's considering his position. It may be that you will have to call him in a couple days.
Shaun will call you tomorrow at a time convenient to you.","communitythirteen","lundi","fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©vrier","dmilledix","hillaryclinton","nowkend","wksix","topic4","topic25","topic36",578,503

Cheryl, Bellerive hit me up before the beginning of a donors' meeting this morning to say that it's important that the US
troops in country be covered by a bilateral agreement that defines, among other things, their immunities.
He noted that

I was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Congressman Jack Murtha. From the battlefields of Vietnam to the hills
of Western Pennsylvania to the halls of Congress, Jack Murtha lived by the Marine Corps credo ""Semper Fidelis,"" never
wavering in his faithful commitment to the country he loved and the men and women who bravely defend her. In war
and in peace, he fought for what he knew was right, even when it was unpopular. He was a fierce advocate for working
families struggling with a changing economy and for better health care and equipment for servicemembers. And over
the course of more than three decades in Congress, he became one of our nation's most respected voices on national
security and foreign policy. Presidents of both parties sought his advice and generations of colleagues looked to him for
leadership and wisdom. As Senator from New York serving on the Armed Services Committee, I was fortunate to call
Jack a friend and mentor. And as Secretary of State, I continued to rely on his expertise and judgment. I knew that Jack
would always shoot straight, like the Marine he was, and never shy away from a difficult question or a tough fight. Today
our country has lost a decorated war hero and a distinguished public servant. The men and women of the our armed
forces have lost a tireless champion. And the people of Pennsylvania's 12th district have lost a neighbor, an advocate,
and a true friend. My thoughts and prayers are with them and with Jack's beloved wife Joyce and their family. He will be
sorely missed.","communitythirteen","lundi","fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©vrier","dmilledix","hillaryclinton","nowkend","wksix","topic14","topic16","topic2",1563,503

around 830 am (DecIan and I agree that if you call McG you also must call Robinson). Brown proposes to speak with you
at 820 or so to bring you up to speed before those calls.
The current situation is that Brown and Cowen are in Belfast, and met with Robinson, McGuinness, and other parties
until 330 in the morning Belfast time. They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants the
current parades commission abolished because it gives Republicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow the
parades issue to be tied to the devolution issue.
The key message to McGuinness is to keep working this thing through -- not to take any drastic action that would bring

Empey still not on board apparently so the ""community confidence"" round may be used to put pressure on him to do so.
Our intervention on Thursday night/Friday morning was seen as a very important moment/catalyst. That, coupled with
the jobs losses that day and the fact that the radio and tv phone-in lines and newspapers were full of commentary

Chief negotiator says Palestinians will submit request as soon as Bosnia take over Security
Council presidency. 'Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't
witnessed before,' he says
The Palestinians will ask the United Nations Security Council to unilaterally recognize an independent Palestinian
state within the 1967 borders early next month, chief negotiator Saeb Erekat was quoted as saying by the Maan
News Agency Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters in the West Bank town of Jericho, Erekat said the Palestinians are waiting for Bosnia to take
the presidency of the Security Council before submitting the proposal.
""The Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't witnessed before,"" Erekat added. ""And
this is due to the efforts exerted by the Palestinian leadership and by President Mahmoud Abbas.""
According to the report, Erekat expressed hope that the US would not veto the proposal, and also called for South
Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.
Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and Bolivia have all recognized a Palestinian stare over the past few weeks.
The Palestinians have recently announced their plan to introduce a draft resolution at the UN Security Council
condemning Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
On Friday the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat quoted Erekat as saying ""the negotiations (with Israel) are over.
Now is the time for decisions, not negotiations.""

more labor union votes for leader, which accounted for one-third of total. Ed's ""new generation"" rhetoric covers that

Attached is the ppt that AMS will give tomorrow at the A/S meeting. It likely will take most of the time to go
thorough.
We are not handing out copies until others who are editing it have had the chance to go through it carefully.
If you have the chance, take a look through and make sure nothing is too problematic for flashing on the
screen, recognizing the goal is by the end of the day, to have a version that can be handed out on Weds to the

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
IRAQI NATIONAL ELECTIONS
I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days. There is
no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with the
families who lost friends and loved ones, and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm their
commitment to democracy and to charting their own future free of fear and intimidation.
Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces, which organized the voting and
ensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country, Iraqi men and women from all parts of the
country were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely.
I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill, General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel who
supported this historic effort.","communitythirteen","dimanche","mars","dmilledix","hillaryclinton","wkend","wkten","topic26","topic33","topic1",1141,503

success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.
- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last
week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).
Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long
and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.
- the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.
Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.
- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin
is met w howls of laughter and Act II called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from
the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's

the bison stuffed animals - who knew?

He has spent time in recent weeks in the Middle East and has feedback for you on how people there feel, where they
want to go and how that affects the relationship between the US and countries in the Middle East. Sandy is not a

a careful implementation plan at the direction of you and Judith, is what exactly this means for USG specific activities.Cheryl:

the end of the government's 10-month-old construction slowdown at midnight- symbolically renewing settlement
activity that threatens to derail peace talks with the Palestinians. Some 2000 people headed to another nearby
settlement for a larger rally, where activists released 2000 blue and white balloons- the colors of the Israeli flag- into the
air at sundown. The balloons were meant to symbolize the 2000 apartments that settlers say they are ready to be built
immediately. The festivities went ahead despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's call for the settlers to
show ""restraint"" as the curbs are lifted.

negotiations with Israel if the renewed West Bank settlement construction is not halted. Those expected
to attend the meeting include representatives of the PLO workers committee, the Fatah central committee,
and the heads of other political parties. After making a decision, the Palestinian leadership is expected to
announce that the final decision of whether to leave the talks will be made by the Arab League, who are
planning to discuss the issue October 4. The head of the Palestinian negotiation team, Saeb Erekat, said
""there are no half-way solutions on the settlements issue."" In a statement released to the press after
meeting with U.S. Consul General Daniel Rubinstein, Erekat called on the American government and the
European Union to force Israel to stop all construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, in order to
give peace a chance. Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the Palestinians would not be
able to remain in the peace talks after Israel's decision not to extend the moratorium. Gheit added that
""despite the international efforts, I am not optimistic [about peace talks]"".","communityeleven","jeudi","septembre","dmilledix","humaabedin","nowkend","wkforty","topic8","topic5","topic23",1225,373

CdmDear Cheryl,
I hope all is well with you. We are all thrilled about the perception of HRC and the job she has been doing for us all.
Makes me miss my old ambassadorial days working with State.
As you can see by the below email to me, husband David Dunn (a lawyer/not lobbiest at Patton Boggs, and an old friend
of Hillary's) and another Hillary friend, Herb Miller, will be on Hainan Island on Sat. and Sun. Oct 30 and 31 (already Sat.
morning there now) to go to the city of Sanya to visit the Mayor. They are there to commit to a major commercial mall
project in Sanya with their Chinese partners, Huinong Capital.
They believe that HRC will be visiting Sanya as well in the same time frame and will meet with officials there.
They would love to say hello to HRC to show US businessmen committed to expanded US China trade relations if convenient for her
and not an interference. David can be reached at

In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monserior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in
Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the
country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on
U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
increased coca production.","communitythirteen","dimanche","juin","dmilledix","hillaryclinton","wkend","wktwentythree","topic39","topic11","topic14",2190,503

G.O.P. Support for Arms Treaty
By
PETER BAKER
Another Republican senator signaled Tuesday that he may vote for the new arms control treaty with Russia if it comes
up for a vote before the Senate adjourns for the year later this month.
Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who did not run for re-election, said he hopes that the Senate will get a chance
to vote on the treaty, known as New Start, right after a deal on tax cuts and a spending resolution to keep the
government operating.
""Start is an important issue. It should be fully debated. I am leaning towards supporting it,"" he told Andrea Mitchell on
MSNBC. ""I haven't made a final decision,"" he added, noting that Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the lead Republican
negotiator on the treaty, still has concerns. ""He has some reservations, but I believe many of those reservations are
being addressed,"" Mr. Gregg said.
President Obama has made passing the treaty his top foreign policy priority for the lame-duck session. Under the
Constitution, approving a treaty requires a two-thirds super-majority, or 67 votes, meaning that Mr. Obama needs nine
Republicans assuming all 58 Democrats stick with him.
At this point, more than that many Republicans have offered positive-sounding statements like that made on Tuesday","communityone","mercredi","dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cembre","dmilledix","richardverma","nowkend","wkfortynine","topic32","topic3","topic6",1317,31

broker on specific core issues, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said on December 12. Appearing on the ABC
program ""This Week,"" Fayyad indicated that progress toward a peace settlement could occur in the short-term despite
Israel's refusal to halt construction of new settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. However, Israel must
provide specifics about its position on core issues such as what a Palestinian state would entail, the status of Jerusalem
and the return of refugees, Fayyad said, adding that the lack of a new settlement freeze erodes trust in the process.
Asked if the United States would need to offer so-called ""bridging"" proposals on specific issues to try to stimulate
negotiations, Fayyad said that ""may be necessary."" ""It may be unavoidable, actually, for the United States, acting as a
broker at some point, to come in with bridging proposals so we make this happen,"" he said. The interview, which
included Israeli opposition leader and former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, took place two days after U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton outlined a direction for the peace process after giving up on trying to persuade Israel to again freeze
settlement construction as a condition for the direct talks to resume.","communityeleven","dimanche","dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cembre","dmilledix","humaabedin","wkend","wkfifty","topic8","topic4","topic3",1370,373

If there is an appropriate way to do so, I wondered if you might convey to Secretary Clinton how much it meant to me
personally and to so many of us that she led us last night for cathartic story-telling and laughter. It was such a terrible
evening, but she managed to ignite warmth at a moment when everything felt frozen still. Her ability to lift us all up
after a trip to Canada, hosting a huge reception, and on top of her own loss, was itself a rallying cry to soldier on the way
Holbrooke would have insisted we do. She helped fill the tremendous sense of void with funny memories and an
appreciation of how deeply he touched so many of us. I felt better by the time I left, and still do.

I am up in the middle of the night in Brussels and took a quick stab at stringing together some of the pieces of the ""moral
argument"". I am not sure how coherent it all is, (caveat lector) and don't want to confuse efforts to pull together talkers
for 5, but thought I'd share.
This could be boiled down further into key points (and the below is meant to stand on its own as an argument but not be
exclusive of othersÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âre internet freedom and wikileaks, for example)
But I think it gets at some of what I think is missing...esp the bit at the end about the alternative---
D
1) Clear thinking demands avoiding simple analogies, or false syllogisms. Some have called WL
whistleblowing. Some have lauded it for contributing to transparency. But the comparison and inferences don't
hold up. Whistleblowing is when someone reveals an act of official wrongdoing, and because it is official
wrongdoing we assume that it's in the public interest to know about this and hold the culprits
accountable. Instead what WL is exposing, by and large, is a vast number of official acts of rightdoing-
diplomats engaged often with partners from other governments or civil society, in solving the kind of practical
problems that arise in a world made up of nearly two hundred nations. Many of the legitimate objectives of
these officialsÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âwhether securing dangerous materials or negotiating agreements that will advance good
governance and human rightsÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âcannot be accomplished in a single conversation or interaction. Instead they are
long-term ongoing projects that require trust, tactical sequencing of interactions, and above all, confidence. It's
not the ultimate objectives that are confidentialÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âindeed, they are quite public and leaders routinely outline
them in speeches, world peace, security, prosperity, etc. Rather it's simply the case that accomplishing good
objectives demands the kind of cooperative engagement that confidential relations permit, and so, while we can
and should maintain a general commitment to transparency, we also can and should recognize that a responsible
government that that is to be held accountable for delivering benefits for its people, will sometimes need to
work in confidence in order to do so. Whistleblowing exposes misconduct that runs counter to the interests of
citizens. Wikileaks undermines good conduct on behalf of citizens.","communityone","mercredi","dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cembre","dmilledix","jakesullivan","nowkend","wkfifty","topic38","topic19","topic31",2698,247

See below.Madam Secretary,
The outpouring of condolences from the international community and the Afghans for Richard's passing has been
extraordinary. We have had a steady flow of visitors from the NATO and diplomatic community and, most importantly,
Afghans of every walk of life for several days who have come to sign the condolence book.
Today, during my weekly meeting with President Karzai, I took along the condolence book to be signed at the
Palace. President Karzai signed and wrote a nice tribute to Richard and graciously allowed us to bring an Embassy
photographer to memorialize the occasion. A photograph is attached. We will separately arrange for a copy to be
signed by President Karzai for Kati.
Separately, I would ask that you thank Mike Mullen for permitting the USO show with which he is traveling to stage an
unprecedented performance at the U.S. Embassy today. Allowing Embassy Kabul to be the site of a USO show in
Afghanistan was very gracious of Mike as normally USO shows are only held at military bases. We had an extraordinary
turnout of our civilian and military team from all over Kabul gathered today to see Robin Williams and other
entertainers. Mike remains a real champion of our civil-military cooperation and teamwork.
Respectfully,
Karl
